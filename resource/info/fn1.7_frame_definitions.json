    "Abandonment": "An Agent leaves behind a Theme effectively rendering it no longer within their control or of the normal security as one's property.   'Carolyn abandoned her car and jumped on a red double decker bus.'  'Perhaps he left the key in the ignition'  'Abandonment of a child is considered to be a serious crime in many jurisdictions.'  There are also metaphorically used examples:  'She left her old ways behind .'",
    "Abounding_with": "A Location is filled or covered with the Theme.  The Location is realized as the External Argument, and the Theme either as PP complement headed by with, in or of.  NB:  This frame does not include uses of adjectives like paved when they merely specify the Type of some location, as in \"paved and unpaved roads\".  'The waters of the bay teemed with fish.' 'The waters of the bay were teeming with fish.' 'The road was completely covered in mud.' ",
    "Absorb_heat": "An Entity (generally food) is exposed to a Heat_source whose Temperature may also be specified.  Generally, the Entity undergoes some sort of change as a result of this process.  'Bacon was frying in the pan, and a great heap of eggs already lay steaming on a plate.' 'If it cooks at 400 for an hour, it 'll be nothing but a pile of ash!'",
    "Abundance": "The Quantity of a Collection occurring in a Place has a particular Measure. The Measure of the Collection is referred to only in terms of how the Measure diverges from a norm for Collections of the specified type. Degree may further refine the relation of the Measure to the norm.  'Beauty is abundant in a land flowing with snowmelt.'  'Detritus of life abounds in the atmosphere. '  'There was a recent discovery that exotic microbes teem in the rocks hundreds of metres beneath the floor of the Pacific Ocean.'",
    "Abusing": "In this frame an Abuser repeatedly treats the Victim in a cruel and violent way, including physically harming or forcing the Victim to engage in sexual activity against their will. The Victim usually lacks the power to resist or fight back. A Type of abuse may be indicated. There may also be a Degree. ' Her father verbally abused her mother. '",
    "Access_scenario": "A Theme is or is not capable of entering or accessing a Useful_location because of/despite a Barrier.",

    "Accomplishment": "After a period in which the Agent has been working on a Goal, the Agent manages to attain it.  The Goal may be a desired state, or be conceptualized as an event. '' 'Jeremey obediently accomplished this task.'  'In response, the Prime Minister has simply cited his free-market accomplishments. '  ",
    "Accoutrements": "A Wearer wears accessories, which are made of  some Material and may have a Style.  Most of the accessories are non-essential (clothing) items. 'She wore a black velvet hat on her head.'",
    "Accuracy": "An Agent is involved in an activity whose degree of success is dependent on a parameter of the action matching a particular set of values of a continuous variable or variables (e.g. quantity, location, time).    The Agent, or metonymically the Instrument or Means action, is described in terms of the actual or expected Deviation between the location, time, or quantity in the activity and the location, time, or quantity which is necessary for the intended event.  'The Longview Rangefinder is accurate to within one foot per hundred yards .' 'His estimate was off by an order of magnitude .'  'The fork truck operator must be fairly accurate in his aim.'

    "Active_substance": "A Substance causes an Effect.  The Substance is produced by a process understood as directed towards the Effect.  The Name for the material that makes up the substance may also be given.  'A rationale for using denatured gp160 as a therapeutic agent in HIV-infected people is to boost the immune response .'

'Only after the potion has been drunk does the active ingredient form. DNI'  'The sarin agent might have been a leftover shell from a chemical-arms dump. '",
    "Activity": "This is an abstract frame for durative activities, in which the Agent enters an ongoing state of the Activity, remains in this state for some Duration of Time, and leaves this state either by finishing or by stopping.   The Agent's Activity should be intentional.    This frame is intended mostly for the inheritance of common FEs, and to provide the frame structure for the beginning, ongoing, finish, or stop stage of an Activity, each of which constitutes a subframe of this frame. This frame should be compared to the Process frame.",
    "Activity_abandoned_state": "An Agent is in an unfinished part of an activity.",
    "Activity_done_state": "An Agent has completed an Activity. '' 'Finally I am done cleaning the apartment.'  'Construction on the new Safeway was done by October.'",
    "Activity_finish": "An Agent finishes an Activity, which can no longer logically continue. This frame is a subframe of Activity. '' 'Jason completed grading the papers late Sunday night.'  'Upon completion of the final exam, Ava tossed out her notes. '",

    "Activity_prepare": "An Agent prepares for an Activity. '' 'The troops were preparing themselves for the mission.'  'The boats are getting ready to leave the pier.'",
    "Activity_ready_state": "The Protagonist is in an initial state, before beginning to be involved in the Activity, but all pre-conditions for performance of the Activity have been satisfied.  In many cases, the Protagonist is an intentional agent, but there are other uses in which the agent is deprofiled, and the Protagonist is an entity which is essential to the Activity.   Alternatively, the Activity may be indicated by a Salient_entity which stands in for the Activity.  This Salient_entity may also be an intentional agent, but need not be.  'She 's not ready ! DNI.' 'He 's ready to talk , I think .' 'Is the UK government ready to do a u-turn on passport-ID cards ?' 'Check and see if Sal is ready for the bathtub .' 'The world is finally prepared for him !'",

    "Actually_occurring_entity": "Against the background of a contextually salient non-real world, for instance a hypothetical, imagined, simulated, expected, projected, or dream world, an Instance of a Type encountered in a relation or event in the real world is presented as being different from the instance found in the non-real world. Of course, the real-world Instance of the expected Type may also be presented as not occurring, as in the last example below.   'Actual results may vary.' 'ACTUAL results may vary.'  'Also present is the actual policeman, now 20 years older and helping to cast and prepare the young actor who'll be portraying him onscreen.'

'There are some cocaine addicts living in the house across the street.'",
    "Adding_up": "A Cognizer computes a Result on the basis of input Numbers by addition.   ' Add up your savings.' ' This is a cumulative figure obtained by adding up the cost of treating a given volume of specific diseases. ' 'When he later took the trouble to add up the bill he discovered that the actual cost was Fr 1,481 , around 140 pounds : an overcharge of 40 pounds' 'Chaperones  tallied the number of tickets sold at the school dance at more than 1000.'",
    "Adducing": "A Speaker mentions a Specified_entity filling a Role, thereby providing information which supports a point of the Speaker.  'He cites the chief original observations adduced by Darwin as evidence for his theory.'  'Mexico cited the drought, now in its eighth year, to avoid releasing Texas' full share of 110 billion gallons per year from the reservoirs.

Damasio already pointed to the cingulate cortex in his 1994 book.'",
    "Adjacency": "A Figure is located adjacent to a Ground. This is equivalent to the Figure and Ground either constituting or being associated with a zone, with each zone in contact with the zone of the other.  'The two houses were adjacent , so she bought them together .' 'The bedroom adjoining hers was much smaller .' 'The park borders a very upscale neighborhood .' 'While you solder , make sure the neighboring pins don't get overheated . DNI '  This frame is intended to cover productive metaphor cases such as those found in \"adjacent web pages\"--referring to pages that metaphorically \"share a border\" by virtue of sharing a hyperlink, as well as many additional cases of entities which are cognitively associated in other ways.  There are a number of less productive metaphors that are also intended to be included in this frame, e.g. \"behavior bordering on lunacy\", \"cleanliness is next to godliness\", despite the fact that conventionally we do not find \"adjacent to lunacy\", etc.  Though these expressions sound creative, they are immediately understandable and contextually unobjectionable.",
    "Adjusting": "An Agent changes a Part of a complex entity with regard to some Feature in order to achieve some Imposed_purpose affected by the Feature.  The complex entity is often a device or mechanism, but may also be an abstract entity such as the economy.  Also, the full entity may be used in place of the Part.  'I need to adjust the thermostat to around 80 degrees when she visits.' 'It didn't work the first time , so she had to tweak the oven a little .' 'Greenspan expressed confidence that the current calibration of interest rates was not an overcompensation .'",
    "Adopt_selection": "An Agent has an Attribute which can take different Values, and the Agent selects and then begins to use some Value for that Attribute.  The Attribute includes both physical (shape, color) and abstract (belief, practice) types.  For some LUs in this frame, it is common for only the Value to be expressed, with the Attribute implicit. (Often this implicit attribute can be given second-layer expression on the Value. Note that such second-layer annotation should be assumed in the first two examples below.)  'They scoff at their opponents and assume an air of superior knowledge' 'There are times when teachers should adopt a neutral stance in discussion of morally controversial issues.' 'A person does not have to make the statement \"I adopt this as my position\" to do so.' ",
    "Aesthetics": "An Entity is judged to be sensually pleasing or intellectually interesting to a (generally implicit) Judge.   'We saw this beautiful boat with the red sails several times' 'We camped here on the beach and had an absolutely lovely early morning walk through farm fields' ",
    "Affirm_or_deny": "A Speaker uses language to affirm or deny the truth of a Message to some Addressee. Instead of (or in addition to) a Speaker, a Medium may also be mentioned. Likewise, a Topic may be stated instead of a Message.   'She affirmed her loyalty to the cause.'  'He denied that he had ever believed in the existence of God.'  'BBC News confirmed the story about the refugees.'  ",
    "Age": "An Entity has existed for a length of time, the Age. The Age can be characterized as a value of the age Attribute, or a Degree modifier may express the deviation of the Age from the norm. The Expressor exhibits qualities of the age of the Entity.  'This building is twenty thousand years old.'  'My grandpa is really old'  'Junior is only five weeks old.'  'A cunning oldish voice called out from the crowd.'  'His age was 23 at the time.'  ' People of  age 55 or older should consult their physician. '  'I have a 13-year-old cousin'  'My grandma is old'  There are additional patterns that the LUs in this frame occur in which are not licensed by a particular lexical head but by a construction.  Additionally, there are patterns that evoke this frame without any overt lexical head that are part of this frame.   'She is 45 years of age.' 'Billy  is 13.'     ",
    "Aggregate": "This frame contains nouns denoting Aggregates of Individuals.  The Aggregates may be described by an Aggregate_property.   'An army of postal workers descended on my office.'  ",
    "Aging": "An Entity is undergoing a change in age typically associated with some deterioration or change in state.   'This bark ages and turns black.'  'The U.S. is to upgrade aging missile defense systems with advanced tech.' ",
    "Agree_or_refuse_to_act": "A Speaker either agrees to or refuses to engage in a Proposed_action, proposed by an Interlocutor. '' 'They agreed to express their outrage with editorials in today's paper.'  'The man's refusal to accept blood severely hampered his treatment after the car accident.' ",
    "Agriculture": "In this frame an Agriculturist cultivates Food.  The location or Ground where the Food is cultivated by the Agriculturist is often expressed.  '' 'Peasants were encouraged to cultivate basic food crops such as beans and corn'.  'Shrimp farming seems to be a recipe for disaster'  'Some fields were probably cultivated only in the dry season CNI'",
    "Aiming": "An Agent adjusts an Instrument to enable it to interact directly with a difficult-to-access Target_location.  Usually, there is a Targeted entity at the Target_location which is mentioned in its place.  'If you aim your weapons somewhere else , I 'll be more likely to talk .' 'The sortie targeted primarily resupply points , but these included several civilian areas . INI' 'A good marksman still should take aim for a moment before each shot . INI INI'",
    "Alignment_image_schema": "An Alignment_match region has the same orientation as the relatively linear Ground.  The Alignment_mismatch region is oriented perpendicularly to the Ground.",
    "Alliance": "After having worked separately for some time, two or more organizational or individual Members are now organized in an Alliance so that they may better pursue some common Purposes.  The formerly separate Members may be presented separately as Member_1 and Member_2.  'They formed a loose coalition.'",
    "Alternatives": "There exist a number of different possible Situations that may happen in the future.  (In some cases, the Situation is concurrent or past, and only the knowledge of which has happened is in the future.)  In most cases, there is an Agent involved who has to consider which of the possible Situations will or should occur.  A Salient_entity which is deeply involved in the Situation may also be mentioned.  'You have but two choices for your daughter .'  While all the members of this frame denote possible situations, in principle, this frame could be split into a number of subtypes on the following basis:  ''1. Future.n, and most uses of alternative.n and possibility.n all evoke nothing more than a simple possible situation (not necessarily an Situation) with no Agent; the remaining frames would inherit from this. ''2. Use.n evokes different possible things that can be done with a Salient_entity (i.e., Purposes) and thus uses the Using frame; in this frame, the target denotes the Purpose that can be achieved. ''3. way.n evokes different events that can lead to an Outcome (not necessarily a Purpose); this frame should use the Means frame.  In this frame, the target denotes the possible Means actions. ''4. option.n, choice.n, and many instances of alternative.n and possibility.n, evoke possible Situations that an implicit or explicit Agent can bring about at will.  A Purpose that would be served by bringing these Situations about may be mentioned. A Salient_entity related to the Purpose may occur in place of the Purpose.  ",
    "Alternativity": "In this frame, there is a Profiled_alternative that the speaker wishes to primarily focus on and which is mutually exclusive with a Contrasting_alternative.  It is not possible for both to be true in the same context with the same participants, although the described situation may be true of the same entities at different times, or true of different entities at the same time.  Frames inheriting from this one, e.g. Negation, may indicate which of the alternatives is imagined to be the case, but in other frames related to this one, e.g. Conditional_scenario and Alternatives, both alternatives are presented as possible, and which one is true remains an open question.",
    "Amalgamation": "These words refer to Parts merging to form a Whole.  (The Parts may also be encoded as Part_1 and Part_2.)  There is a symmetrical relationship between the components that undergo the process, and afterwards the Parts are consumed and are no longer distinct entities that are easily discernable or separable in the Whole.  'The two droplets merge, and then travel down the windowpane even faster.'",
    "Amassing": "A Recipient (who may or may not be agentive) ends up in possession of a Mass_theme (which may be conceptualized as a single mass entity, or may be a group of individual entities).  Some lexical units (e.g. stockpile) specifically indicate an intentional Recipient.  This frame differs from Gathering_up in that this frame refers specifically to the acquisition and (according to expectation) long-term possession of entities, rather than (as in the Gathering_up frame) simply talking about causing a group of entities to be located in the same place.  In sum, Gathering_up concerns (co-)locations, but Amassing concerns possession.  'Bogs accumulate carbon for thousands of years.'",
    "Ambient_temperature": "The Temperature in a certain environment, determined by Time and Place, is specified.  'It's too hot to do anything today.'  'Nome is pretty cold this time of  year'  'Last Tuesday was a real scorcher.'  'Tomorrow is gonna be  chilly.' 'I ca n't go out into the cold . DNI DNI' ",
    "Ammunition": "A piece of Ammunition is a disposable artifact to be fired as a projectile in a weapon with the purpose of causing harm or damage.    'The octagenarian inventor's vest repels armor-piercing bullets. '  'It is armed with a automatic loaded 105 mm gun firing anti-tank rounds'  'Depleted uranium munitions are primarily used by the US and the UK.'",
    "Amounting_to": "The absolute Value of a quantifiable Attribute  of an item is determined by adding up the values for the Attribute of the individuals or parts that make up the item. The item is not expressed as a separate constituent but it is presupposed by the concept of Attribute.  Alternatively, the Numbers form an implicit set whose sum is the Value associated with the set.   In some cases what is reported is just the cardinality of the individuals that make up the item so that in effect the Value is a count. In other cases the identity of the Attribute can only be inferred from the Value.   There is no cognizer on the scene in this frame. Instead, the frame focuses on the relationship between the Attribute or Numbers and the Value, which is stable and unchanging regardless of who performs  the calculation.  'Defence is provided in West Germany by armed forces whose number totals close to half a million men and women ' . ' Revenues totalled 568.86m pounds ' 'The WHO estimated that the cumulative total of AIDS cases was more than 1,500,000. '",
    "Animals": "The LUs in this frame refer to biological entities other than human beings and plants, which are labeled by the FE Animal.  ''  'My husband and I adopted a really sweet dog last year.'  'The cows that live on the farm down the road are always mooing loudly.'",
    "Annoyance": "An Experiencer, Expressor, or State has a feeling of annoyance as evoked by a Stimulus or concerning a Topic.  'Peck was annoyed at the interruption.'  'Maggie noted his rather irritated expression.'  ",
    "Appeal": "In the Appeal stage of the criminal process the Convict or his or her Representative applies to a higher Court to reverse the Decision of the lower court on certain Grounds. ' The defense plans to appeal the court's decision on the grounds that the judge violated Code 81.b . ' ' John Michaels will appeal his conviction .'",
    "Appellations": "This frame is only for words that are used as the Titles of individuals. The Title is applied to a Name (surname or full name) and often designates their rank within a man-made institution (e.g. chief, king, bishop, brother) or general social status (mr., miss), or may indicate a kinship relationship (cousin, aunt). Pairings of Title and Name can be used as vocatives (see Attention_getting), while the Titles may not always be vocative on their own.  'He saluted General Fightmeister walking into the room.' 'Everyone stood as Captain Jack Aubrey delivered a toast.' 'Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts is sticking to his guns .' 'Captain Mike Eruzione of the USA Miracle on Ice hockey team in 1980 turns 58 today.'  Most LUs of this frame are related to LUs of the Leadership or Kinship frames, but some (e.g. Lady, Mr., Brother) occur only here.  These LUs differ from normal examples of LUs in Leadership or Kinship in that the LUs are used simply as vocatives or as modifiers of names, to indicate how the individual fits into the general or specific social context.",
    "Apply_heat": "A Cook applies heat to Food, where the Temperature_setting of the heat and Duration of application may be specified.  A Heating_instrument, generally indicated by a locative phrase, may also be expressed. Some cooking methods involve the use of a Medium (e.g. milk or water) by which heat is transferred to the Food.  A less semantically prominent Food or Cook is marked Co-participant.   'Sally fried an egg in butter.' 'Sally fried an egg in a teflon pan.' 'Ellen fried the eggs with chopped tomatoes and garlic.'  This frame differs from Cooking_creation in focusing on the process of handling the ingredients, rather than the edible entity that results from the process.",
    "Appointing": "A Selector, often an individual in a leadership role, appoints a Official to assume an official Role in an organization (which can be expressed as the Body).  'Press secretaries accredit journalists to the sessions.'",
    "Architectural_part": "An entity is integrated into a building as a Part of a (possibly unexpressed) Whole which may refer to the whole building or merely to a sub-part of the building.  'We need new counters for the kitchen'  'The storm ripped off the bathroom's roof'  ",
    "Arithmetic": "This frame describes a certain type of mathematical scenario in which two numbers, labeled Term1 and Term2, interact via some mathematical operation.",
    "Arithmetic_commutative": "This frame describes types of arithmetic operations and statements which have the commutative property, i.e. the operation is bi-directional, e.g. addition and multiplication. The terms involved are either individually labeled Term1 and Term2 or grouped together as a single noun phrase labeled Terms. ",
    "Arithmetic_non-commutative": "This frame describes types of arithmetic operations and statements which are not commutative, i.e. the operation is uni-directional, e.g. subtraction and division. Because of the non-commutative nature, terms must be separated from each other in the form of Term_1 and Term_2 instead of a combined Terms FE.",
    "Armor": "An Asset, the safety of which is desirable, is protected from damage by a covering, the Armor. The Armor covers part or all of the Asset and is designed to absorb force from an oncoming Danger.  'They were wearing nothing but primitive wooden armor.'  'An extra level of safety is provided by the soldiers' ballistic armor.'",
    "Arraignment": "At a court hearing, a Defendant is informed of the Charges against him or her, (usually) enters a plea, and a decision is made by a Judge as to the amount of bail, if any. '' 'Mortimer and Isabella were hurried off and arraigned before parliament in November.'  'If the court rejects the appeal, the 19 young men facearraignment on murder charges before the tribunal in the southern city of Port Harcourt.' ",
    "Arranging": "An Agent puts a complex Theme into a particular Configuration, which can be a proper order, a correct or suitable sequence, or a spatial position.  'He arranged the elements in the pattern that we now call the periodic table.'  'Try to order them by importance. CNI ' ",
    "Arrest": "Authorities charge a Suspect, who is under suspicion of having committed a crime (the Charges), and take him/her into custody.'The police arrested Harry on charges of manslaughter.'",
    "Arriving": "An object Theme moves in the direction of a Goal. The Goal may be expressed or it may be understood from context, but its is always implied by the verb itself. '' 'Some students arrived at the school on Sunday.'  'It was his arrival at Nijmegen in 837 that made the Vikings withdraw.' ",
    "Arson": "A Perpetrator intentionally sets fire to his own or someone else's property, often in order to collect an insurance payment on this property.  'Two men were charged with arson.'",
    "Artifact": "An Artifact is deliberately made or modified by an intelligent entity to be put to a certain kind of Use.  Various properties of the Artifact may be specified, such as its Creator, Time_of_creation, Name, Type, and the Material of which it is composed.  The Artifact may or may not be a physical entity.  'There are reports that Kim Il Sung asked China to share its nuclear weapons technology.'",
    "Artifact_subpart": "A Component has a distinct Function in the operation of a complex Artifact, which is not regarded as complete unless it is assembled from a number of different Components. Each Component may also be described by their Creator, Time_of_creation, or Material.  'Most of the cost comes from the price of engine parts.' 'We'll need to find a metal partfrom 1982.'",
    "Artificiality": "An Entity is evaluated for whether or not it belongs to a particular Reference_category in a context where its category membership is doubtful. The criterion or criteria that are relevant to evaluating Reference_category membership depend on the individual lexical units and/or on the context. Typically, either the material composition of the Entity, its method of creation, or the identity (and proper authority) of its creators are critical for proper category membership. Note that Entity also covers behaviors.  'It can be hard to get your money back after discovering you've bought a bogus autograph for hundreds or thousands of dollars! '  'It can be hard to get your money back after discovering  you've bought a BOGUS autograph for hundreds or thousands of dollars! '   'A bogus policeman pulling over motorists was arrested after stopping a car carrying four real officers.'  'A BOGUS policeman pulling over motorists was arrested after stopping a car carrying four real officers.'   'You people are pretty thick if you think you have evidence to prove that the moon landing was fake.' 'You people are pretty thick if you think you have evidence to prove that the moon landing was fake.'  ",
    "Artistic_style": "This frame contains LUs that express the Form which a piece of Artwork represents. The Form may also represent the entire body  of an Artist's work. The Form may be further characterized by the Time of some Artwork's creation or other Descriptors.  'Her style of painting is an excellent blend of traditional and modern.' 'The whimsical style of this piece is very effective.'",
    "Assemble": "In this frame a group of Individuals intentionally come together to form a Group.  Alternatively, a grammatically more prominent Party_1 assembles with a Party_2, expressed as an oblique phrase.  If this asymmetric construal is chosen, Purpose only relates to Party_1.   'We assembled in the courtyard to talk about our future plans.' 'Our study group is convening outside today.' 'The Dodgers meet the San Francisco Giants tomorrow at Dodger Stadium.' ",
    "Assessing": "An Assessor examines a Phenomenon to figure out its Value according to some Feature of the Phenomenon.  This Value is a factor in determining the acceptability of the Phenomenon.  In some cases, a Method (implicitly involving an Assessor) is used to determine the Phenomenon's Value.  'Each company is then evaluated for their earning potential. CNI ' 'From the evidence of the pilot studies the risk of damage to the test subjects was rated too high to continue. CNI' 'He weighed his options carefully.'",
    "Assigned_location": "An Individual is assigned a Station to remain at, usually in order to accomplish a task. The Station may have an intended use based on its features (e.g., a vendor's booth), or it may be temporarily assigned a use.  'The guards who remained at their stations had no idea what was going on two floors below.'  'Return to your post!'",
    "Assistance": "A Helper benefits a Benefited_party by enabling the culmination of a Goal that the Benefited_party has.  A Focal_entity that is involved in reaching the Goal may stand in for it.  This Frame has unique Frame-to-Frame Relations: it inherits from and uses the Intentionally_act frame. This is atypical of FrameNet's frame relations.  'Will you help the Government find your brother?' 'Maybe Stephen should assist him with the last manuscript.' 'They helped me psychologically to overcome the physical loss I had suffered.' 'You have helped him tremendously by showing him  how to stand up for himself and by being his friend.' 'By bringing assistance to his troops wherever they were in trouble he aided them greatly.'",
    "Asymmetric_reciprocality": "Perspective on Reciprocality in which Protagonist_1 acts on or is related to  Protagonist_2.  The relation or event is construed as asymmetrical, inasmuch as Protagonist_1 is presented as more agentive, if agency is involved (such as in conversation, participating), and Protagonist_2 is presented as more passive.  In cases of comparison or other relations (e.g. resembling, being near), Protagonist_2 is construed as suitable as a reference for Protagonist_1, often because Protagonist_2 is more temporally stable and/or is more salient and widely known.",
    "Atonement": "An Agent has committed a Wrong in the past and is making Amends for it. The Degree to which the Amends are adequate may also be expressed.  'He atoned for his sin with good works.'",
    "Attaching": "The Attaching frame covers two situations: a scene in which somebody causes one thing to be physically connected to something else; or a scene in which somebody causes two things to be connected to each other.  In the first, the frame includes an Agent who attaches an Item to a Goal by manipulating a Connector, creating an asymmetric relationship between the Item and the Goal.  In the second, the Agent attaches two Items to each other, where each serves as a Goal for the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two Items. In both cases, the  Connector remains to bind the two entities (either Item and Goal, or two Items), without creating a new entity.  'The robber tied Harry to the chair.'  'Make sure you bind his wrists as tightly as possible.'",
    "Attack": "An Assailant physically attacks a Victim (which is usually but not always sentient), causing or intending to cause the Victim physical damage.   A Weapon used by the Assailant may also be mentioned, in addition to the usual Place, Time, Purpose, Explanation, etc.  Sometimes a location is used metonymically to stand for the Assailant or the Victim, and in such cases the Place FE will be annotated on a second FE layer.  'As soon as he stepped out of the bar he was set upon by four men in ski-masks.' 'Is he invading Iraq just to cover other shortcomings?' 'Then Jon-O's forces ambushed them on the left flank from a line of low hills.'",
    "Attempt": "An Agent attempts to achieve a Goal. The Outcome may also be mentioned explicitly.  'John attempted to climb Mt. Everest.'  'It was another failed attempt to climb Mt. Everest.'",
    "Attempt_action_scenario": "This frame represents the core action of an Attempt, where an Agent has a Goal and performs some Means action that they believe will achieve the Goal.  See its two perspectivized frames for further information.",
    "Attempt_distant_interaction_scenario": "An Agent attempts to interact with a relatively distant or indirectly accessible Target using some Instrument (which may be a body part, e.g. hand).  The Agent's ability to manipulate the Instrument and put it in the Target location is in question.  The most common types of distant interaction involve an Agent attempting to move the Instrument ballistically so that it contacts the Target (e.g. Shooting_scenario), or an Agent attempting to direct an Instrument that enables perception at a Target_location to be examined.",
    "Attempt_means": "An Agent attempts to achieve a Goal using some Means.    'John tried using a crowbar to open the door.' 'They tried opening the window in order to rob the store.'  Very frequently, an entity involved in a Means action stands in for the Means, and similarly a Goal may be metonymically expressed with an entity related to a Goal situation:  'John tried a crowbar on the door.' 'They tried the window in order to rob the store.'  Unlike the Attempt frame, the Means is focused upon, and the Goal is often implicit.  This frame answers the question of how something is to be attempted, rather than what is being attempted.  The frames can be most reliably distinguished by paraphrasing a sentence with \"give X a try\", since \"give try\" belongs only in this frame.",
    "Attempt_obtain_food_scenario": "A Seeker is trying to obtain Food and is seeking it within the context of a Ground. ",
    "Attempt_obtain_mineral_scenario": "An Agent attempts to obtain a non-renewable resource, often solid minerals or metals, but also oil, water, and other valuable substances.",
    "Attempt_suasion": "The  Speaker expresses through language his wish to get the Addressee to act in some way that will help to bring about events or states described in the Content. There is no implication that the Addressee forms an intention to act, let alone acts.     'Mr Smithers always encourages the employees to stay late and work harder.'  'Dennis Rodman advises moderation in all things. INI'  The Content most prototypically refers to an action that the Addressee will carry out themselves, but may (in the case of valences with a non-finite Content clause) merely refer to a situation that they have indirect influence over, as in the following  'When I talked to her, I suggested that he be removed from office . DNI '",
    "Attempting_and_resolving_scenario": "An Agent has a particular Goal in mind, and then uses some Means that they believe will bring about the Goal.  The Agent succeeds or fails inasmuch as the result of the Means action matches the Goal.",
    "Attending": "An Agent goes to an Event and is present in a relatively non-participatory way.  'The Angolan guerrillas will attend a September meeting in Zaire.'  'We just go to the movies when it rains.'  'His attendance at the funeral did not go unnoticed.' ",
    "Attention": "This frame concerns a Perceiver's state of readiness to process and consider impressions of a Figure within a Ground.  It is often unknown to the Perceiver whether or not the Figure exists within the Ground. Alternatively, the Expressor may be expressed as showing signs of the Perceiver's state of attentiveness.  'Legislator tells consumers to be alert to dioxin levels.'  'They demand an attentive gaze, a careful accounting of parts.'",
    "Attention_getting": "This frame covers terms used to get someone's attention, including Interjections (e.g. hey, yo) and certain terms of address (Address_term), the latter of which may serve the function of attention getting.    'Hey.' 'Hey, boy.' 'Hey, boy, come over here now!'  ",
    "Attitude_description": "The lexical units in this frame are descriptions of a Cognizer's Attitude about or outlook on a State_of_affairs.     '' 'Carl is becoming more pessimistic about the negotiations every day.'  'The benefits of cluelessness come from living in a society where people take an optimistic view of life.' '' The State_of_affairs can be expressed without a Cognizer in many cases, as shown in the following: '' 'The situation is fairly grim at the moment.' ''  ",
    "Attributed_information": "A Proposition is attributed to a Speaker or a Text.  'According to the Press Trust of India in an article published on its Web site Thursday, the woman has been identified as 31-year-old Aafia Siddiqui, who was being sought by U.S. officials last week along with two other men, including one whose last known address was in Miramar, Fla.'  ' In addition, according to Section I3.5b, the spacing of stud shear connectors along the length of a supporting beam shall not exceed 36?. '  'According to the Pope, Muslims believe in the same God and according to Jesus, Muslims are the greatest in Heaven.'",
    "Attributes": "An Entity has a particular Attribute with some Value. This frame is primarily for inheritance.",
    "Authority": "An Agent has the means to affect a Theme along the lines of a certain Domain. There is an imbalance of influence or power within a certain Domain that favors the Agent (often due to some Source) over the Theme.   'His authority over his subjects was given to him by God.' 'Congress has the power to enact laws.' 'Only the King has the authority to declare war.'",
    "Avoiding": "An Agent avoids an Undesirable_situation under certain Circumstances. That situation may be an activity (e.g. going to school), or an entity (perhaps) metonymic for such an activity or situation (e.g. the curb).  In this frame, the situation is undesirable from the Agent's point of view (e.g. evade), and contrasts with scenes in which the situation is specifically undesirable to someone else (e.g. forbear) or from the point of view of an external morality (e.g. abstain).  'Mike avoided his supervisor at all costs.'",
    "Awareness": "A Cognizer has a piece of Content in their model of the world.  The Content is not necessarily present due to immediate perception, but usually, rather, due to deduction from perceivables.  In some cases, the deduction of the Content is implicitly based on confidence in sources of information (believe), in some cases based on logic (think), and in other cases the source of the deduction is deprofiled (know).  'Your boss is aware of your commitment.' '' Note that this frame is undergoing some degree of reconsideration.  Many of the targets will be moved to the Opinion frame.  That frame indicates that the Cognizer considers something as true, but the Opinion (compare to Content) is not presupposed to be true; rather it is something that is considered a potential point of difference, as in the following:    'I think that you are awesome.'  In the uses that will remain in the Awareness frame, however, the Content is presupposed.  '' This frame is also distinct from the Certainty frame, in that it does not profile the relationship of the Cognizer to the Content, but rather presupposes it.  In Certainty, the Degree of confidence or certainty is expressible as a separate frame element, as in the following:  'She absolutely knew that he would be there .'  ",
    "Awareness_situation": "A Cognizer has a piece of Content in their model of the world due to deduction, inference, or similar means of arriving at information from perceivables.",
    "Awareness_status": "Some Content is part of the mental model of a Cognizer. The Cognizer arrives at the mental model not by direct perception but by reasoning from perceived phenomena. Alternatively, the Role of a particular object is known to be applicable to that object.  'That fact is known to many.'  'The presumed killer was last seen driving south on the interstate.'",
    "Bail_decision": "This frame covers a step in a criminal process in which a  Judge decides whether the Accused should be released on bail, and, if so, what the amount of the bail should be.  '' 'Thorsen, of Grimstad, Norway, was granted $100,000 bail until June 18.'  'He was granted conditional bail by Teesside Magistrates.'",
    "Basis_for_attribute": "A piece of information about a Landmark is presented as more accessible and useful for determining or communicating a similar type of information about the Trajector.  In this construal of a situation, there is a (more) profiled element, the Trajector, and an un- or less profiled element, the Landmark.  In combination with a schematically-defined Profiled_region (with a pre-defined relationship to the Landmark), the Landmark serves as the basis for understanding the status or location of the Trajector.    'The cat in the shed purred violently .' 'The shed around the cat shook .' 'We 'll have to leave before noon .' 'In the 1990s , though , the rate at which DNA could be read revved into high gear .' ",
    "Be_in_agreement_on_action": "Two (or more) people (the Parties, also encodable as Party_1 and Party_2) have an agreement. Both sides are construed as having a commitment to an Obligation--the relationship is understood to be symmetrical or reciprocal. Instead of a specific mention of the Obligation, a Topic expression may be used to indicate the domain covered.  'The US and Russia have an agreement to share early warning data on missile launches.'",
    "Be_in_agreement_on_assessment": "The Cognizers have a similarity (or dissimilarity) in their Opinion. The Cognizers may be expressed separately, with Cognizer_2 being the basis for establishing the Opinion of Cognizer_1.  Rather than a specific Opinion, a phenomenon about which a similar or differing Opinion is held, the Topic, may be specified. A specific Opinion may also go unmentioned when the Opinions of the Cognizers are understood as answers to a Question.  'Dr. Gerry and Mr. Pond agree in their impressions.'  ' This copyeditor and I mostly see eye to eye on things.'  'I agree with you that everything should be monitored to keep the person from wasting time and protecting the interests of the company.'  ",
    "Be_on_alert": "A Protagonist has become aware of a possible Danger (a dangerous event or a Dangerous_entity that might participate in an event harmful to the Protagonist) and is ready to engage in an Activity in response to that Danger.  'All tropps are on high alert for possible intruders following an attack on a nearby compound.'  'we're on alert to stop anyone trying to sneak in.'  'we're on guard for possible sabotage.'",
    "Be_subset_of": "A Part is considered to be a member of the set described by the Total. The relationship between Part and Total subset-superset rather than part-whole (as it is in the frames Part_whole and Including).  'Dr. Nelson numbers among the world?s foremost geotechnical engineering experts.'  'Restaurant-Pizzeria Dante counts among the few restaurants of Florence where you can find good typical Tuscan and fish dishes and a first-class pizza.'",
    "Be_translation_equivalent": "A Target_symbol in a Target_representation  system is presented as equivalent to a Source_symbol in a Source_representation system in the ability to express a particular Content.  'The term employment area translates the French zone d'emploi.' 'The term employment area translates the French zone d'emploi.'  'The term translates the Russian raznorechie (literally \"different-speech-ness\").' 'The term translates the Russian raznorechie (literally \"different-speech-ness\".'",
    "Bearing_arms": "A Protagonist has (or does not have) a Weapon.  The Degree to which the Protagonist is armed may also be described.  The Protagonist is normally a human but may be a device that has subsidiary weapons.  'Apparently, the suspect is armed with a shotgun.' 'After she pulled the .45 from her sock drawer, she felt well enough armed to face anyone coming in.' 'The Tomahawk missile packs a lot of heat .'  'An individual with a right-to-carry license may continue to carry in a \"school zone\" in compliance with existing state and local laws. INI'",
    "Beat_opponent": "A Winner has victory over an Loser.  'He always beats me at chess.'",
    "Becoming": "An Entity ends up with some Final_quality--a new fact about the Entity. Alternatively, based on a cluster of changes of characteristics, the Entitynewly meets the conditions for being a member of a Final_category.  'The weather turned cold .' 'You can become a firefighter today !'  This frame should be compared with the Transition_to_state frame, which is more general in allowing arbitrary descriptions of a final situation:  'We ended up telling him to leave .'  There is no way to effectively paraphrase such a sentence in the Becoming frame.  ",
    "Becoming_a_member": "A New_member becomes a member of a socially-constructed Group. 'Seven new members and the three countries joined the alliance five years ago.' 'Most new students enroll in a university without declaring a major.' 'It represents every man and woman who has enlisted in the armed forces to protect our families and serve the community.'",
    "Becoming_attached": "An Item comes to be attached to a Goal, with a Connector forming a bond between the Handle of the Item and the Goal (or some part of it). Alternatively, multiple Items may form a bond between each other.  'According to plan, the front part of the hull quietly attached to the docking gear.'  'The cells bind together.'",
    "Becoming_aware": "Words in this frame have to do with a Cognizer adding some Phenomenon to their model of the world. They are similar to Coming-to-believe words, except the latter generally involve reasoning from Evidence.  '' The words in this frame take direct objects that denote entities in the world, and indicate awareness of those entities, without necessarily giving any information about the content of the Cognizer's belief or knowledge. These words also resemble perception words, since creatures often become aware of things by perceiving them.  'Later that night, they found the barely-alive victim inside the Red Hall estate flat.'  'Almost immediately, the police discovered the wrought-iron crypt gate swinging open.'  'In the bag on the tableI could vaguelydiscern two bottles of wine and several cartons of cakes and other goodies.'  'People passing through recognize it from afar, by the clouds of coal dust darkening the air.'   General Grammatical Observations: Passive forms of the verbs in this frame can occur with extraposed clauses expressing Phenomenon: 'That year it was discovered that consumers preferred the older model.' 'It is not always recognized how much work goes into a dinner party.'",
    "Becoming_detached": "The Becoming_detached frame covers two situations: a scene in which one thing comes to be physically detached from something else; or a scene in which two things come to be disconnected from each other. In the first, the frame includes an Item that detaches from a Source, creating an asymmetric relationship between the Item and the Source. In the second, the Items detach from each other, where each serves as a Source relative to the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two Items. The Items that were formerly attached re-appear as the two separate or potentially separate entities that they were throughout.  'The ship became decoupled from the dock.'",
    "Becoming_dry": "An Entity loses moisture with the outcome of being in a dry state.  'The slab dries very quickly.'",
    "Becoming_separated": "A Whole separates into Parts, or one part of a whole, called Part_1, becomes separate from the remaining portion, Part_2.  'This small channel meanders through marsh and wetland, splitting into several smaller channels that empty into Lake St. Clair.'  'Just crack one open and if the yoke quickly separates from the whites, they are probably bad.'",
    "Becoming_silent": "In this frame a Speaker ceases speaking, sometimes about a particular Topic. An Expressor may also be indicated. '' The words of this frame are very frequently used imperatively, to the extent that certain words and phrases (not another word, silence, shhh) can only be used this way.  'Finally, Jan shut up about his car accident.' 'The children's laughter quieted down.' 'Somehow, he managed to hold his tongue.'",
    "Becoming_visible": "An Entity that is previously not visible to a Perceiver becomes visible.  'The armada appeared on the horizon at sunset.'  'The captain ordered his men to dig at the X and the corner of a chest appeared.'",
    "Behind_the_scenes": "Artists work at various tasks that further the completion of a film, play, television show, or other similar Production.  Artists never appear on stage or in front of a camera.  Some (e.g., a director) may interact with the actors (on-screen participants) of the Production.  Often times a particular Production is made for distribution by a Distributor, by a particular Studio, or in a specific Medium.  The Artists may be categorized into Type or work in specific Medium. 'Steven Spielberg directed several films for Universal Pictures.' 'Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment produced Jurassic Park for MCA.' 'Surprisingly, this film producer was willing to work for a cable company.' 'Independent producers often win big at smaller film festivals.'",
    "Being_active": "An Agent is described as pursuing an Activity, expending some effort. The Agent may be active in a particular Role. Alternatively, the Activity itself may be described as having an Agent who is expending effort.  In some cases, the Activity may involve a Salient_entity which may stand in for it.  'Sky, a Korean War veteran, was active in his opposition to Vietnam and continues to protest current combat in Iraq.'  'She is active in the community by establishing parent groups, life skills program, sharing circles and various Aboriginal cultural activities for young women..'  'John Colville was quite active as a land speculator in both Virginia and Maryland.'",
    "Being_at_risk": "An Asset is in a state where it is exposed to or otherwise liable to be affected by a Harmful_event, which may be metonymically evoked by reference to a Dangerous_entity. Words expressing relative safety (i.e., lack of risk) are also in this frame.  'If you are a farmer, you are at risk for hearing loss caused by noise exposure in your work.'  'No child is secure from the temptation to do what \"my friends\" are doing.'  'Our nation is making a disastrous mistake thinking that we can have security from people: There is only security with people. '  'You don't have security against impersonation unless you have security against eavesdropping.'",
    "Being_attached": "An Item is attached by a Handle, via a Connector, to a Goal, or Items are attached to each other.  There may be a Dependent_state, which depends crucially on Item(s) being attached.  'My thumb was stuck to the tube of glue.'  'The prisoner's legs were shackled.'",
    "Being_awake": "A Protagonist is awake at some Time and Place.  This entails the Protagonist having a higher general level of awareness of the surroundings than when asleep.  'He's awake!'",
    "Being_born": "This frame concerns the inception of the life of a Child, generally human, at a particular Time and Place.  The Relatives may also be mentioned.  'Little Jessie came into the world at 8 last night.'",
    "Being_contained_within": "In this situation, a Trajector is contained inside a Landmark.  This frame serves only to relate the Containing frame (with LUs such as contain.v) with the Interior_profile_relation frame (with LUs such as inside.prep).",
    "Being_detached": "An Item is detached from a Source, or Items are detached from each other.   'When the snow plow is disconnected from the vehicle, extend the lift cylinder to the end of its stroke and coat the chrome rod with a light grease.'  'The gold leaves that are unattached to the engraved surfaces fall off.' 'By 5:00 to 5:30 (depending on the time of year) the boat is unmoored and loaded.'",
    "Being_dry": "An Item is in a state of dryness. 'The shingles  are dry.'  'The apple is completely dehydrated.' '<fex name = \"Item\" >The mop is dry.'",
    "Being_employed": "An Employee has a Position doing work in a particular Field, or doing work on a particular Task, for which an Employer gives Compensation to the Employee.  ' Undocumented foreigners are working as  building contractors for Laing Builders.'",
    "Being_in_captivity": "A Theme is held in captivity by an Agent or Cause.  'Twenty soldiers were in captivity for over a month before they were released'  'I never release my prisoners.'  'She couldn't believe she was prisoner in her own home.'",
    "Being_in_category": "An Item belongs to a Category, as (often implicitly) conceived of by a Cognizer.  'To me this counts as historical fiction because it is based on real events.'",
    "Being_in_control": "A Controlling_entity has control of a Dependent_entity, Dependent_situation, or Dependent_variable.   'She was in control of the empire within two days.'  This frame is distinct from Control in that the Controlling_entity is not fully asserted to be currently controlling the Dependent_entity, Dependent_situation, or Dependent_variable, but rather is attentive to it and capable of making the situation correspond to the desired state at any time.",
    "Being_in_effect": "A particular Binding_principle is (or is not) operative, that is, any obligations, restrictions, and any other aspects of the Binding_principle are (or are not) in effect.  The Binding_principle can be expressed as being in effect for a particular Duration, or at a particular Time or Place, or under certain Circumstances.  'This law will only become in effect during the last three weeks of the year.' 'The statutory wetlands definition is effective immediately.' 'This contract is binding on all parties.'  Although the <em>in effect</em> is properly in this frame, <em>(put) into effect</em> is analyzed in the Execute_plan frame. This is in part because to <em>put an (evacuation) plan into effect</em> is to actually execute the plan (to evacuate), while to <em>put a plan in effect</em> is to determine that in the future the plan may have to executed, i.e., to make the plan binding. Similar observations can be made for <em>come into effect</em>.",
    "Being_in_operation": "A Device or machine is in (or out of) service. Note that being broken or functional is a separate issue from being turned on or off. This latter notion is what the present frame is concerned with. <br /> The Time when and the Place where the Device is in use may be specified, as may be the Purpose a backgrounded human User had in turning the Device on or off.    'The TV is on' 'The lights were off when I came by.'  ",
    "Being_incarcerated": "A Prisoner is punished for committing a Crime by being confined to a Prison for a specified period of time.  'Phil's serving time at Pelican Bay.'",
    "Being_included": "A Part is profiled as being a subset or constituent subpart of a Whole. This is in contrast to Inclusion frame, wherein the same relation is seen from the point of view of the Whole.",
    "Being_located": "A Theme is in a stable position with respect to a Location.  'Our offices are located about two miles south of I-85 .' ",
    "Being_named": "This frame concerns entities conventionally being referred to by particular names.  'Her name was Lola.' ",
    "Being_necessary": "A Dependent state-of-affairs has a Requirement as a prerequisite for obtaining or occurring.  'The atomic bombings were probably not necessary to win WWII without a mainland invasion of Japan.'  'We will take the required measures, regardless of the yelping of the left. DNI'  ' Two tokens are necessary for county to county trips.'",
    "Being_obligated": "Under some Condition, usually left implicit, a Responsible_party is required to perform some Duty.  If they do not perform the Duty, there may be some undesirable Consequence, which may or may not be stated overtly.  'It is my duty to fight any attack on the Brotherhood .' 'This country has the responsibility to support its citizens' right to express themselves.' 'I am obligated to pay or they'll double the fine.'  NB:  Contrast this frame with Likelihood and Preconditions frames, which involve many of the same lemmas.  Many LUs which might be expected to be found here (should, must, have to) are actually in the Required_event frame. Our analysis is that these LUs do not evoke an obligation directly, although they are frequently used in contexts that are consistent with an understanding of obligation and are pragmatically strengthened to (defeasibly) imply an obligation. ",
    "Being_obligatory": "Under some Condition, usually left implicit, a Duty needs to be fulfilled by a  Responsible_party. If the Duty is not performed, there may be some undesirable Consequence for the Responsible_party, which may or may not be stated overtly. Compare this frame to the Being_obligated frame.    'It would behoove us to comprehend and personalize what Jesus had to tell his disciples'  'Fressed too much at the obligatory BBQ. INI'  'When I was in HS, marching band was mandatory in order to participate in any of the other ensembles INI'  'Should insurance be compulsory?'",
    "Being_operational": "An Object with an understood function is or is not in a state ready to perform that function.  'The remote is almost broken.'  'Hand me that broken watch so I can throw it away.'",
    "Being_pregnant": "This frame describes the experience of expecting and bearing a child, from the perspective of the parent(s). ",
    "Being_questionable": "In this frame, an Entity or Behavior is suspicious or otherwise subject to question.  The general implication is that the Entity or Behavior provides evidence for some (as yet unproven) socially undesirable conclusion about a (usually implicit) Social_actor.  (Such conclusions often include the idea that some individual is lying, or that a crime was committed.) 'We found some suspicious checks lying on his desk.' 'It was rather suspicious of you to leave the party just before the police arrived.' ",
    "Being_relevant": "A Phenomenon is related to some cognitive action, the Endeavor, of a Cognizer. In many LUs, the Cognizer is null-instantiated and implied as being the speaker or another participant of the Endeavor.  'This book is very relevant to my essay.' 'This book is very relevant to my essay.' ",
    "Being_rotted": "An organic item, the Patient, has undergone the natural process of rotting  and decaying with a possible expression of the Degree to which the rotting has occurred. 'The coconut milk became rancid.'",
    "Being_up_to_it": " An Entity meets the pre-conditions for participating in an Activity that is judged to be difficult for it to participate in, either due to inherent properties of the Entity or temporary Circumstances. A Degree modifier may indicate by how much the Entity exceeds or falls short of the minimum requirements.  'Little Tommy was not up to getting out of bed because he was quite sick.' ",
    "Being_wet": "An Item is in a state of wetness with the possibility of the wetting Liquid being mentioned, along with the Degree of wetness. ' The mop is drenched with water from last night's rain.'",
    "Besieging": "An Assailant, a group of armed forces, surrounds the Victim, a military location and the people within it, in an attempt to cut the Victim off from the outside, with the goal of either forcing their surrender or weakening them so that an invasion would be successful. A successful siege is often followed by the Assailant taking control of (the land held by) the Victim.  'Towards the end of the summer, a great English host besieged the Danish fort of Tempsford and took it, killing the last Danish king of East Anglia.'",
    "Beyond_compare": "Compared to its Competitors, a Standard is at the high end of a scale with respect to some Variable. The Competitors are frequently not realized syntactically. 'The taxpayer is supporting a system unmatched in wastefulness .' 'The drawing room was a place of unmatched squalor.' ' She was envious of her mother's matchless beauty.'  ''When there is no overt Variable it must be understood from the context. 'He was unmatched   by any other  politician of his time.'  ''When the target occurs as the modifier of a predicate nominal, it  is tagged as Standard, rather than Variable.  'They were matchless needlers of each other.'",
    "Billing": "A Billing_authority communicates in written form that the Debtor owes the Owed_party (often the same as the Billing_authority) some amount of Money for certain Goods (including services) provided by the Owed_party or to clear a debt for a Bad_action by the Debtor against the Owed_party.",
    "Biological_area": " This frame contains words that denote large ecological areas as well as smaller locations characterized by the type of life present--in other words, geography locations as defined by biota.  'I've spent a long time in the rugged prairies of northern Llorwyn.'",
    "Biological_classification": "This frame has to do with scientific taxonomy.  The lexical units in this frame include the seven major classifications in which organisms are grouped based on common biological characteristics.  These classifications are labeled Rank in this frame.  The Members or Subtype of the Rank is often expressed with the use of the target-denoting noun. '' 'Phylum Arthropoda contains crustaceans, insects, spiders and other creepy-crawlies.' '' 'The snow leopard belongs to the kingdom Animalia.'",
    "Biological_entity": "The LUs in this frame refer to biological entities labeled by the FE Organism. An Organism is described as something that can be alive, or have naturally occuring biological processes and functions; however the concept of life is often used metaphorically for non-organic entities which resemble or act as if they have organic life.  'NASA may someday discover a new lifeform from another planet.'",
    "Biological_mechanisms": "A trigger mechanism brings about a change in a biological system.  'The reflex increases cardiac output.'",
    "Biological_urge": "An Experiencer is in a State where a biological urge is signaling the need to perform a certain action such as eating, drinking, stopping exertion, sleeping, regurgitating, or having sex. The Duration, Time, Place, or Degree of intensity associated with the occurrence of the urge may also be indicated.  In this frame, the Experiencer does not necessarily want to perform the action that would fulfill the urge, and there is no specific focus associated with the urge.  'Mike feels hungry.'  'Sam was thirsty after dinner.'",
    "Birth_scenario": "An Offspring is born to a Mother and Father, collectively referred to as Parents. This event happens at a particular Time and Place.",
    "Board_vehicle": "A Traveller boards a Vehicle that they intend to use as a means of transportation either as a passenger or as a driver.  'On the 5th of December, 1834, we embarked on board the merchant ship Hellespont.'  'She boarded the train ahead of him.'  'On 19 September the battalion embussed and headed southward into the Swordfish training area some 40 miles away.'",
    "Body_decoration": "This frame concerns the decorations that human beings have on or apply to their bodies. 'Abby rarely wears lipstick.'",
    "Body_description_holistic": "This frame covers descriptions of an entire human body, viewed as a gestalt (as opposed to descriptions based on salient body parts).  The Frame Elements are Individual and Figure.    'Chuck is muscular.'  'Chuck has a muscular body.' ",
    "Body_description_part": "This frame is concerned with words that describe a person based on a salient part of their body. 'He was a blonde guy.' 'He was a peg-leg.' ",
    "Body_mark": "In this frame a Body_mark is present on a Possessor's body.  It may be located at an Attachment and have a Descriptor.  A Cause may also be indicated. It may be a temporary condition or a permanent one.   ' Mark has a cancerous mole on his back.'",
    "Body_movement": "This frame contains words for motions or actions an Agent performs using some part of his/her body.   A number of words in this frame occur as blends with Communication, in which the action has an Addressee.  For example,   'Pat nodded at Kim.'  These examples differ from Communication.Gesture in that no specific message need be expressed, as in  'She nodded to him to sit down.'  Since this frame involves a particular type of motion, it contains the frame elements Source, Path, Goal and Area, which originate in the motion frame.  All of these frame elements are generally expressed in PP Complements.  'The boy swung his legs from under the table.'",
    "Body_parts": "This frame covers words for Body_part(s) (BP) belonging to a Possessor (Poss), which may be characterized by a Descriptor (Desc). The location of the BP may be identified in terms of  its Attachment or its Orientational_location.  A Subregion of a BP may also be indicated.   '' 'He had to brace his right arm against his leg in order to fight the roll.'  'The dog measured its blond belly in the mud.'  ''",
    "Bond_maturation": "A Financial_instrument (a bond or insurance) fulfills a condition at a certain Time after which the Issuer of the Financial_instrument is legally obligated to pay the Holder a monetary Value, based on the instrument's original Principle and the Interest rate.  'The bond had matured to its full value <fex name=\"\">at 30 years.'",
    "Borrowing": "The Borrower takes possession of a Theme with the knowledge that the Borrower will have to give the Theme back to the Lender after a Duration of time.  This frame differs from the Lending frame in that this frame profiles the Borrower in active sentences, whereas the Lending frame profiles the Lender. '' For the time being, this frame includes both the transfer event itself and the end state of the event, as shown in the first two examples following:  'I am borrowing the book about modal particles from the professor.'  'I borrowed the book from him and returned it a long time ago.'  'Not only did I have to borrow a gown, but I was also lent a jacket!'  'The girl borrowed the car from her sister for a couple days.'  Along with other ways of temporarily taking possession (e.g. \"putting something in your pocket for a while\"), this frame is used non-literally to refer to Stealing.  In this use, the Borrower is a thief, the Lender is a Victim, and the Theme is the Goods:  'Were n't nobody lookin' so I borrowed it off her .'",
    "Boundary": "This frame contains words that describe a Boundary between two Entities.  In many cases, the Boundary is the border between an Entity and some unnamed space, generally conceived of as empty.  'The canyon is the border between the two states.'",
    "Bounded_entity": "This is an abstract frame for bounded areas, used mostly for FE inheritance.",
    "Bounded_region": "An Exterior, Surface, Boundary, and Interior are picked out relative to the Ground.  This Ground may either occupy only the Boundary (in which case the Interior is negative space) or the Ground may fill the Interior.",
    "Bragging": "A Speaker talks about a Topic, which may be an action performed by the Speaker or an entity or state of affairs that they are associated with in order to suggest that the Speaker is worthy of admiration. The Speaker may give an explicit Reason why the Topic redounds to their credit. Alternatively, a Message frame element can be used to directly describe what the Speaker says, leaving the more specific Reason for admirability to be inferred. Instead of the Speaker, the action may be attributed metonymically to the Medium, or possibly the Expressor.  ''   'Turkish officials boasted of giving 'tens of thousands of dollars in surreptitious payments' to a prominent American politician.'  'He then vaunted his own clan, but failed to mention Emanuel Ungaro, who described the omission as ''lamentable''.'  'The press release boasts that \"a direct connection between the cartridge and the system\" means no more having to blow dust out of game cartridges.'  '70's comics like Chevy Chase and Steve Martin over-stated their egotism and preened over their superiority.'",
    "Breaking_apart": "A Whole breaks apart into Pieces, resulting in the loss of the Whole (and in most cases, no piece that has a separate function).  'The plane violently broke apart in mid-air.'  'And then, I finally realized that it must have been the case that a meteorite broke apart into at least 3 large pieces.'  Many of these verbs can also refer metaphorically to the breaking apart of institutions. (See the frame for \"schism\".)",
    "Breaking_off": "An single Subpart breaks off from a Whole.  'The original sword may have chipped off of the statue long ago.'",
    "Breaking_out_captive": "An Agent brings about the end of a Theme's captivity at a Location_of_confinement in contravention of the plans or desires of a captor.  'His accomplice freed him from Sing Sing prison thanks to his disguise.' ",
    "Breathing": "An Agent causes Air to move in a direction, usually specifying either in or out of the body.  'Lee breathed the hot desert air.'",
    "Bringing": "This frame concerns the movement of a Theme and an Agent and/or Carrier.   The Agent, a person or other sentient entity, controls the shared Path by moving the Theme during the motion. In other words, the Agent has overall motion in directing the motion of the Theme.  The Carrier may be a separate entity, or it may be the Agent's body. The Constant_location may be a subregion of the Agent's body or (a subregion of) a vehicle that the Agent uses.  'Karl carried the books across campus to the library on his head.' 'Karl carried the books across campus to the library in his truck.' 'Karl carried the books across campus to the library by truck.' 'The truck carried the books across campus to the library in specially designed boxes.' The  FEs include Path, Goal, and Source.  Area is an area that contains the motion when the path is understood as irregular.   This frame emphasizes the path of movement as opposed to the FEs Source or Goal as in Filling or Placing. ",
    "Building": "This frame describes assembly or construction actions, where an Agent joins Components together to form a Created_entity, which is profiled, and hence the object of the verb.  'Jack built a new house out of bricks.' 'We glued the airplanes together.'",
    "Building_subparts": "This frame includes words that name subparts of buildings that can be occupied by people.  'Mary left the room in a huff.'",
    "Buildings": "This frame contains words which name permanent fixed structures forming an enclosure and providing protection from the elements.   'The baroque church, built in 1635, has a very rich interior' 'The city tour includes the 16th-century monastery of the Transfiguration and Church of Elijah the Prophet' 'An ancient stone church stands amid the fields'  'Jack built his house in the style of the day.'",
    "Bungling": "An Agent performs an Action incorrectly.  The affected Patient may be mentioned metonymically for the Action.  'Mickey botched that swing.' 'Julia bungled the cake.' ",
    "Burying": "An Agent or Cause places a Theme under a surface (often the ground) into a Goal location.  'The suspect buried his gun in the ground while fleeing the police.'",
    "Business_closure": "A business locale, the Entity, ceases to provide services and closes.   'Exxon went under.'",
    "Businesses": "A Proprietor owns or runs a Business which provides a Product (which may be goods or services).  'The consumer electronics company Apple has exploded with popularity in recent years.'",
    "Cache": "A hidden Cache of a Resource is kept safe and available for later Use. The existence, location, and other information about the Cache is kept secret by the Possessor.  'They no doubt had to move their arms cache after several members defected.'  'Do you have a stash of money somewhere?'",
    "Calendric_unit": "Words in this frame name the different parts of the calendric cycle, both man-made and natural. The Unit (e.g. Tuesday) specifies some time period as part of a specific larger temporal Whole (Tuesday of next week), or may be resolved to an exact time span by a Relative_time (next Tuesday).   'Jo's mother will visit on this coming Tuesday.' '' Very frequently, the Whole or Relative_time are left out (i.e., DNI), and often should be interpreted as a time period overlapping with the communication, but more generally must be understood from context.  So, for example, in the first sentence below, we can imagine that the Whole refers to a year (e.g., 1983) that was already mentioned or established in context.  In the second example below, the most likely interpretation is the nearest April, whether in this year or the next, and this interpretation is best indicated by indicating the Relative_time is DNI.  'On April 2 , she finally found her mother . DNI. '  'I 'll come back in April .DNI' '' Most members of this frame can be used with iterative events, either with a plural Unit (on Tuesdays), or marked with every (every April).   'On Tuesday and Thursday afternoons , we have tea .' In this use, when the Whole is omitted, the Whole should be marked INI. 'On Tuesdays , we have tea . INI ' '' Words of this frame often occur in a non-lexical construction that uses some Calendric_unit expressions to establish when an event occurred.  To capture this information, we use the extra-thematic FEs Landmark_period and Trajector_event (see Temporal_collocation) on the second layer, as in the following: 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' 'Last Tuesday she said I 'd have to come back .' We do not use these FEs for cases where the temporal relationship is introduced by an overt word of the Temporal_collocation frame (like on, in, at, before, etc.).  Most lexical units of this frame occur in this construction, with or without requiring a Relative_time, while some idiosyncratically do not, so information on the use with the extra-thematic FE Trajector_event is lexically specific. '' There are a number of non-lexical constructions that evoke this frame, including date constructions (the third, May 5), decade constructions (the oughts), year constructions (1975, 24 BCE, 10 AH, year 19, etc.), and time-of-day constructions. Although not annotated in this frame, examples such as the following show that the FEs Unit and Whole are quite appropriate: 'The 4th of April dawned clear and cold .' 'December 11 was when Alix finally left .' 'The 23rd will be snowy . DNI ' 'Nothing much happened in the 90s , did it ? DNI ' As described above for the lexical targets that evoke this frame, some non-lexical versions of the frame may also occur in a non-lexical Temporal_collocation construction: 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' 'No-one has forgotten what happened the 5th of November !' ''  Words in this frame figure into a variety of temporal schemas, realized as constructions, primarily cases in which the Calendric_unit serves as a Landmark_period in the Temporal_collocation frame. There are families of constructions in which these words occur, including ones in which weekday names combine with day part names using particular prepositions (e.g. on Wednesday morning, cf. on Wednesday, but  in the morning) and ones in which  calendric terms fill the slots in multi-word expressions such as  N-after-N (e.g. day after day),  N-by-N (e.g. week by week),  N-to-N (e.g. month to month), etc. More can be found on these in Fillmore (2002).  Note, also, the connection between this frame and Frequency, specifically that many iterative adjectives and adverbs are based on calendric terms (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).      ",
    "Candidness": "This frame contains adjectives and nouns that describe the truth or sincerity of communication. These words, analogously to behaver-evaluating words, can apply either to Speakers or to the Messages they produce. They can occur with about-PPs expressing Topic.   'Evelyn was candid with me about the party.'",
    "Capability": "An Entity meets the pre-conditions for participating in an Event.  A Degree modifier may be included to indicate by how much the Entity exceeds or falls short of the minimum requirements.  'Conductor software gives us the hands-on capability to provide updates immediately'  'The GOP is afraid that it might not be capable of keeping the seat vacated by Dunn.'  'NASA is unable to communicate with Mars rover.'  'He can fly a kite.'",
    "Capacity": "An Entity has the ability to contain a Theme.  'Our facility seats up to 500 people.'",
    "Capital_stock": "This frame concerns Stock, a purchasable and sellable asset representing a Shareholder's share in a company (the Issuer). Stock entitles the Shareholder to profits of the Issuer company, as determined by the governing board of the Issuer company. LUs in this frame can denote the type of capital stock investment into a business (common or preferred) or the investment itself.  Common stock is also known as ordinary stock or voting stock.  'My ten preferred shares in Google are worth more than your ten common shares in Apple.' ",
    "Cardinal_numbers": "This frame presents a situation where there is a certain Number of instances of an Entity or a certain Number that quantifies a Unit. Numbers are used to count any kind of Entity that has distinct individuals, or alternatively, to count Units whose own function is to quantify some property, with the Number associated with each word of this frame differentiating groups, individuals, parts of individual Entitys of different sizes, or to differentiate the quantity of the Units. A countable Entity prototypically occupies its own space separately from other instances of the Entity, and each instance of the Entity has specific kinds of parts or substance or characteristics as specified by the kind of Entity it is described as.   Units (e.g., hours, inches, dozens) have the function of quantifying some property and as a result, naturally occur with a Number to say how the current property compares to the standard quantification of the Unit.  Less prototypical numbers, which occur much more frequently with Units rather than Entitys, describe situations with less than a whole Unitor Entity (half.n), or the lack of a Unit or Entity (zero.num). '' There is also a Precision associated with the Number. In most cases, there is a certain amount of imprecision in the Number that is assumed, especially for so-called \"round\" numbers like twenty.num or hundred.num, and for the class of approximate numbers, like couple.n; for other numbers, e.g. two.num, the expected precision is very high. Separately from this inherent possibility of precision or imprecision, numbers may be modified by an explicit specification of their Precision, with phrases like \"about\", etc.   'Only two senators voted in support of the president .' 'Dr. Malik has confined almost a score of such unfortunates in his basement, you know.' 'We endured forty days of snow .' 'There were thirty of the little blue creatures staring up at him.' 'She had only two pieces of Halloween candy left, but I still had ten! DNI' 'The ship was three degrees off course .'  '' This frame includes extrathematic FEs for a set of non-lexical constructions that put together quantifying expressions.  Firstly, a Number may itself be quantified by having a certain Multiplier, e.g. \"three hundred\".  Secondly, a sequence of numerical expressions may be strung together, with or without \"and\", to produce a Composite_number representing a Number that is the sum of the constituent numbers and that collectively modifies the Entity or Unit.  'Stephen has more than five hundred in his closet! DNI' '' '' As can be seen in the first of the next two examples, when the target is a number in front of another number in the function of a Multiplier, we consider the number it is modifying to be a Unit:  'There are just over six billion people in the world today.' 'There are just over six billion people in the world today.'  The relationship between numbers, as lexical units in this frame, and the broader category of numbers is a complex one.  In particular, there is a semiotic system that arranges the tiny set of numeral symbols (0, 1, 2 ... 9), with some additional symbols (commas, decimal points, fraction lines, scientific notation of exponents) to generate a standard representation for numbers that, while not universal, is at least language independent.  Our description of numbers is focused on the English system of numbers, as would occur in the spoken language or in pronunciations (actually decodings) of written numerals in English.  Since numerals are well-understood by virtually all speakers of most languages, and are well-processed by computers, we do not view the description of these structures in FrameNet as necessary.  As a convenience, we include numerals as wordforms when they coincide with a basic number word of English (e.g., \"3\" is a wordform of three.num). '' Of more interest for the FrameNet Project is the large number of idiosyncrasies in the constructions that use numbers, very few of which will be well-exemplified in our annotation.  These include indications of range (from ... to), approximation (in the neighborhood of), and descriptions of group properties (\"A whopping three singers showed up\")  ''  Technical note: The frame as currently devised does not distinguish between \"six apples\" and \"six of the apples\".  It is clear that in the first case, we are talking about six entities that fit whatever properties apples have.  In the second case, however, there is a specific set of apples that was already under discussion, and the six apples are members of this set.  There is a way of understanding this second case in terms of the first, namely, that \"six of the apples\" is interpreted as six entities with the property of being members of the given set of apples.  Since understanding the second case involves an additional notion of set membership, this could be indicated with a different FE than any we currently have in this frame, perhaps *Set, which is in an exclusion relation with Entity.  However, the major semantic distinction between these two types of Entity is whether there is a definite set, and this distinction is independently indicated by the definite article in examples like \"six of the apples\".   ",
    "Carry_goods": "A Distributor sells, lends, or otherwise distributes a class of Goods. In the prototypical case, the Distributor is a retailer who generally keeps some type of Goods on site for the purpose of selling it to a buyer. Extensions include lending Goods (e.g., libraries, movie rental outlets), organization-internal distribution (as in a hospital), or other non-commercial distribution centers. The Goods are constrained to be a type of item (e.g., canned goods, antique dressers) rather than a particular or unique item (e.g., Smith's last self-portrait, that guitar I saw here last week). Note that a Distributor may carry some particular goods, but may not have it on hand at that exact moment.  'Trader Joe's carries a wide variety of foods, drinks, and househole necessities.'",
    "Catastrophe": "The words in this frame involve an Undesirable_event which affects the Patient negatively.  No agent need be involved. '' 'The first calamity was a disastrous trade war with Holland.'  'It is sad to have to make a living by grubbing around in the dirt of a national calamity.'  'The result has been catastrophic.'",
    "Catching_fire": "A Fuel, some flammable object or substance, ends up on fire.  In this frame, the cause of the fire is not the primary concern, but rather the fact that a fire started.  In rare cases, only the Fire is mentioned and the associated Fuel is not.  '' This frame does not include phrases like \"a fire broke out\" or \"the conflagration started in the bedroom\" as these are deemed to be compositional (see Process_start and Fire_burning).",
    "Categorization": "A Cognizer construes an Item as belonging to a certain Category.  In this process, the Cognizer may either passively perceive the Item and note that it fits the Criteria for a Category, or, alternatively, actively examine the Item for certain Criteria that define a Category (or set of Categorys).    Most members of the frame can also describe a resulting cognitive state of the Cognizer with respect to the Item and Category which no longer requires the current perception or consideration of the Item.  A few LUs (e.g. peg.v, pigeonhole.v) do not readily allow stative interpretation, and a few LUs (e.g. deem.v, regard.v) only allow stative interpretation.  'You 've already stereotyped me as a bimbo, have n't you?'",
    "Causation": "A Cause causes an Effect.  Alternatively, an Actor, a participant of a (implicit) Cause, may stand in for the Cause.  The entity Affected by the Causation may stand in for the overall Effect situation or event.   '' Those frames that inherit the Causation frame have as their background the idea that some event is responsible for the occurrence of another event (or state).  In the  inheriting frame, typically an FE like Agent or Causer is proposed in the place of the Actor, but in the daughter frames, as in this frame, the Actor is semantically dependent on the idea of a Cause (an event or state-of-affairs) that the Actor is a participant in.  Similarly, most inheriting frames profile only the Affected entity, not the full Effect situation which is often incorporated into the frame or the particular target.  So, for example, paint.v in the Filling frame entails the final situation of something (the Affected) being covered in paint (the Effect).  'He made me angry.'  'If such a small earthquake causes problems, just imagine a big one!'  'The strange mutations of the rumor mill in the end led to it being said that he was actually a woman.'  'You 've made it impossible to continue!'  'The ending left me feeling kinda empty.'",
    "Causation_scenario": "A Cause brings about an Effect that would not have occurred otherwise, simultaneously preventing an Averted_situation, which is what would have occurred without the Cause.  The Effect and the Averted_situation are thus mutually exclusive alternatives prior to the Cause event.  In most cases, either the Effect or the Averted_situation is clearly most prominent; this is especially true in the case where the Cause is the action of an Agent, who normally conceives of their action as either bringing about a desirable Effect or avoiding an undesirable Averted_situation. '' In frames that inherit from this one, the Cause is either an event, or an entity that plans or directly causes the Effect may metonymically stand in for the Cause event.",
    "Cause_bodily_experience": "An Agent or Cause affects a Body_part of an Experiencer so that the quality of the Experiencer's perceptual experience of the Body_part is qualitatively changed.  'Chandra massaged Liliana's wrist because it was injured.' 'Chandra massaged Liliana's wrist because it was injured.'",
    "Cause_change": "An Agent or Cause causes an Entity to change, either in its category membership or in terms of the value of an Attribute. In the former case, an Initial_category and a Final_category may be expressed, in the latter case an Initial_value and a Final_value can be specified.  'Our storylines follows the saga outlined by the Ultima Series, but we have modified it in order to make our writing more cohesive.'   'I don't think you can turn that rabbit into a hat.'  'How can a guy that changed his name from Bob Craft to Jack Ass declare anyone defamed his character?'  ' At this juncture, a new development changed the political situation on the island.'  'She had at some time earlier completely changed her clothing and appearance and now stood in front of me dressed like a garden gnome.'  'Hence, when (Hg 0 ) is converted to Hg 2+ , it can be rapidly taken up in rain water, snow, or adsorbed onto small particles' 'Hence, when (Hg 0 ) is converted to Hg 2+ , it can be rapidly taken up in rain water, snow, or adsorbed onto small particles'",
    "Cause_change_of_consistency": "In this frame an Agent or Cause changes the consistency of a Patient from its Initial_state to a Result.  This may take place under certain Circumstances for a Purpose or Reason in a certain Manner.  A Change_agent can also be used.  Note that this frame contrasts with Cause_change_of_phase in that this frame describes causation of a change in a Patient within a particular phase.  'Donna thinned the soup with chicken broth. ' 'The high temperatures curdled the milk.'",
    "Cause_change_of_phase": "A Cause or Agent causes a Patient to undergo a change of phase.  The Result of the change may be given, along with the Initial_state and the Circumstances under which the change can occur.  Note that this frame contrasts with Cause_change_of_consistency in that this frame describes causation of a change of a Patient between different phases (i.e. solid to liquid or frozen to \"unfrozen\").  ' Bob melted the butter. '   'Sally defrosted the chicken to eat for dinner. '  ",
    "Cause_change_of_position_on_a_scale": "This frame consists of words that indicate that an Agent or a Cause affects the position of an Item on some scale (the Attribute) to change it from an initial value (Value_1) to an end value (Value_2). The direction of the change (Path) can be encoded as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference). The rate of change of the value (Speed) can optionally be indicated as well as a second scale (Co_Variable), which the values are correlated with.  '' 'The company is raising the final dividend from 4.34p to 4.57p, to boost the total by 5.3 percent to 6.36p.'  'Similarly, a consumer boom will encourage the authorities to increase interest rates in order to keep money supply on target.'  'United Way of Central Indiana adds value to your investment.'",
    "Cause_change_of_strength": "An Agent causes a Patient to be more strong, often resulting in something that is more secure and safe.  'Local Serbs are strengthening their grip on a narrow corridor along the Sava River between two large Serbian areas.'",
    "Cause_emotion": "An Agent acts to  cause a Experiencer to feel a certain emotion.  'I was so offended by her behaviour towards me.'  'It does not matter if the cartoon is insulting to men.'     ",
    "Cause_expansion": "An  Agent or non-human Cause causes an Item to change its physical size.  The Size_change of an Item may be explicitly indicated or characterized in terms of Initial_size and/or Result_size.  In the default case, expansion is along all dimensions, but sometimes the Dimension of expansion is incorporated or made explicit.  'If the design crashes too often, then try lengthening the wings by a few centimeters, to perhaps 30cm total.  CNI INI '   'As the juice churned with natural process of changing into wine, the gas it created would expand the balloon, and when the balloon eventually deflated, it was ready to drink.'",
    "Cause_fluidic_motion": "An Agent or a Cause causes a Fluid to move from a Source to a Goal along a Path or within an Area.  'I splattered red paint nearby.'",
    "Cause_harm": "The words in this frame describe situations in which an Agent or a Cause injures a Victim. The Body_part of the Victim which is most directly affected may also be mentioned in the place of the Victim.  In such cases, the Victim is often indicated as a genitive modifier of the Body_part, in which case the Victim FE is indicated on a second FE layer. '' 'Rod saw his father beating his mother.'  'In the end Wormtongue is fed up with being beaten so he cuts Saruman's throat to free himself.'  'A mother stabbed to death by her husband made a secret will stating that he must never be allowed to care for their son.'",
    "Cause_impact": "An Agent causes an Impactor to make sudden, forcible contact with an Impactee, or manipulates two (or more) Impactors so that they make mutual forcible contact.    'He slammed his fist down on the table and bellowed something unintelligible.'",
    "Cause_motion": "An Agent causes a Theme to move from a Source, along a Path, to a Goal.  Different members of the frame emphasize the trajectory to different degrees, and a given instance of the frame will usually leave some of the Source, Path and/or Goal implicit. The completion of motion is not required (unlike the Placing frame, see below), although individual sentences annotated with this frame may emphasize the Goal.   '' This frame is very broad and contains several different kinds of words that refer to causing motion.  Some words in this frame do not emphasize the Manner/Means of causing the motion (transfer.v, move.v).  For many of the others (cast.v, throw.v, chuck.v, etc.), the Agent has control of the Theme only at the Source of motion, and does not experience overall motion.  For others (e.g. drag.v, push.v, shove.v, etc.) the Agent has control of the Theme throughout the motion; for these words, the Theme is resistant to motion due to some friction with the surface along which they move.    'She threw her shoes into the dryer .' 'The mechanic dragged the jack out from under the car .' 'We will move the sofa out of the room through the french doors, down the stairs, and onto the sidewalk .' '' ''  This frame is used in a very large number of productive metaphors, not all of which can be outlined here.  The most salient types include causing an entity, construed as a Theme, to change state from an initial state (Source) via an intermediate state (Path) to a final state (Goal): 'Hillary was catapulted to stardom and his life has never been the same since . CNI' 'She felt as though flung from health to illness and back by the day , by the hour .' 'Once our parents are dead , we are catapulted into becoming the older generation ourselves . CNI' 'Croquet was pushed out by tennis .' ''  A particularly divergent subtype casts changing someone's intentions as changing their location: 'Democratsforced the Senate into a rare closed door session .' 'He nudged Mrs Thatcher towards acceptance of a unified Germany .' ''  Another subtype is specifically about causing a change in quantity (the Theme) through some sequence of values (Source, Path, and Goal): 'Bonus payments would be handed out for pushing up voting levels CNI .' ''  Another type, with many subtypes, involves causing an action or state (construed as a Theme) to have an effect on another person or location or conceptual domain. In such cases, theGoal is used for the final affected domain, and Source for initial affected domain, Path for an intermediate affected domain, and Distance for degree of difference between original application of the action and final: 'Jake had been hurling these same insults at her now for years' 'One can not press this argument too far .' 'She shoved the thought to the very back of her mind .' 'She flung him a savage little smile .' All of the foregoing metaphorical uses are annotated in this frame and marked \"Metaphor\", since they seem to be semantically motivated and not lexically idiosyncratic. '' ''  This frame contrasts with the following frames which talk about an Agent changing a Theme's position with respect to a landmark (either Source or Goal): ''  In Placing, the figure (Theme) is profiled as the object, and ends up on the ground (Goal).  The focus is on the final stage of motion, in which the Theme ends up at the Goal, and usually stably remains there. 'Joyce placed the flowers onto the bed.' ''  In Filling, the ground (Goal) is profiled as the object, and the figure (Theme) ends up on the ground (Goal). 'John filled the box with old toys.' ''  In Removing, the figure (Theme) is profiled, and is removed from the ground (Source). 'Jennifer removed the flowers from the bed.' ''  In Emptying, the ground (Source) is profiled and the figure (Theme) is removed from it. 'Jason emptied the box of the old toys .' ''  Words of this frame also differ from the words of the Bringing frame in that they are more general:  either the Agent has a momentary interaction with the Theme that causes its motion, unlike the continuous causation of Bringing, or the Agent continuously acts on the Theme, but there is no supporting object that helps with the motion like the Carrier of the Bringing frame.  ",
    "Cause_proliferation_in_number": "An Agent (or inanimate Cause) affects a Set so that the number of entities that make up the Set changes from an Initial_number to a Final_number. Alternatively, the situation can be described in terms of an Initial_state and a Final_state. In some cases the Attribute (i.e., number) or Difference in number may be mentioned.  'More and more resources have been devoted to halting rogue nation's proliferation of controlled nuclear technology.'",
    "Cause_temperature_change": "In this frame, an Agent changes the temperature of an Item.  A Temperature_goal can specify the desired temperature.  A Temperature_change can also be indicated.  The Temperature_start indicates the initial temperature.  'Margaret Anne chilled the salad to 30 degrees.' 'Heat the water 30 degrees.'",
    "Cause_to_amalgamate": "These words refer to an Agent joining Parts to form a Whole.  (The Parts may also be encoded as Part_1 and Part_2.)  There is a symmetrical relationship between the components that undergo the process, and afterwards the Parts are consumed and are no longer distinct entities that are easily discernable or separable in the Whole.  'Chuck merged the corpora.'' Chuck merged the corpora into a database.' 'Chuck merged the BNC with the AP Corpus into a database.' 'The two forces merged into a single, undifferentiated mass of murderous mayhem.(Sense 2)' 'Melt the butter, then blend it with the room temperature milk. CNI'  ",
    "Cause_to_be_dry": "An Agent causes a Dryee (either a surface or an entire entity, inside and out) to become dry. This should not include examples like \"drying tears\" or \"drying spills\" as these are in the Removing frame.  'Michael dried the clothes.' 'Abby dried out the room with a dehumidifier.'",
    "Cause_to_be_included": "An Agent or Cause makes a New_member part of  Group. The Group may be represented by an individual Existing_member if it implies the existence of a set of members.

    "Cause_to_fragment": "An Agent suddenly and often violently separates the Whole_patient into two or more smaller Pieces, resulting in the Whole_patient no longer existing as such.  Several lexical items are marked with the semantic type Negative, which indicates that the fragmentation is necessarily judged as injurious to the original Whole_patient.  Compare this frame with Damaging, Render_non-functional, and Removing.  'He ripped up the letter faster than you can say \"Jack Robbins\". INI' 'Don't go in there or you 'll be torn to bits!

    "Cause_to_perceive": "An Agent, Actor, Entity, or Medium causes a Phenomenon to be perceived by a Perceiver.  With an Actor, Entity, or Medium, the Perceiver is usually unspecified.   'Aileen showed Rob the book.' 'He exhibited great interest in the project.' 'The second scene depicts  Dad  holding the ball for a place kick.' 'The economy is showing signs of growth.'  NB: This may change in the future, but as of now this frame subsumes three closely-related cause/perceiver alternations:  a.) perception of a specific Perceiver caused by an Agent, b.) perception of some implicit audience caused, possibly unintentionally, by an Actor, and c.) perception of some implicit audience caused by a Medium or Entity. Perhaps this frame is too broad - the different subject FEs seem to all indicate different ways of \"showing.\"",

    "Change_accessibility": "An Agent causes a Useful_location to become accessible (or non-accessible) to a Theme to a certain Degree. Instead of the Useful_location, the scene may be described with reference to a Portal (or part of the Portal, e.g., a door) to the Useful_location.

CNI'  'Take the elevator to the sixth floor and make two lefts. CNI'",
    "Change_event_duration": "In this frame, an Agent or Cause changes the duration of an Event. The Event will then take place for a New_duration, rather than the Initial_duration.

This can be done with by certain Means, in a certain Manner or to a certain Degree.  'The rain delayed the baseball game.'",
    "Change_of_consistency": "In this frame a Patient changes its consistency.  There may be a Initial_state and a Result.  Note that this frame contrasts with Change_of_phase in that this frame describes a change in a Patient within a particular phase (solid, gas, liquid).  'The blood congealed.' 'The liquid gelled into a semi-solid mass.'",
    "Change_of_leadership": "This frame concerns the appointment of a New_leader or removal from office of an Old_leader.  The Selector brings about the change in leadership, for example, by electing or overthrowing a leader. Some words in the frame describe the successful removal from office of a leader (e.g. depose, oust), others simply the attempt (e.g. uprising, rebellion).   'On March 17 , Mamedov appointed Rakhim Gasiyev as Defence Minister .'    ",
    "Change_of_phase": "In this frame a Patient undergoes a change of phase.  Note that this frame contrasts with Change_of_consistency in that this frame describes a change of a Patient between different phases (i.e. solid to liquid or frozen to \"unfrozen\").

    "Change_of_temperature": "In this frame, the temperature of an Item changes.  An Initial_temperature, Final_temperature, or Temperature_change can also be indicated.    'The house had cooled off by a few more degrees by midnight, and we finally managed to eat a bite.' ",
    "Change_operational_state": "A Device or machine is put in (or out of) service either by a volitional Agent or by a Cause event or force acting on the Device.

'The laborer realized that he activated the machine but did not know how to stop it.'  ",
    "Change_position_on_a_scale": "This frame consists of words that indicate the change of an Item's position on a scale (the Attribute) from a starting point (Initial_value) to an end point (Final_value). The direction (Path) of the movement can be indicated as well as the magnitude of the change (Difference).  The rate of change of the value (Speed) is optionally indicated.  Another scale (Correlate), which the values are correlated with, is indicated if it is not the default correlate (namely, absolute time).  '' The distinction between Attributes and Items is not always an easy one. The clear cases involve the expression of the Attribute in an in-PP.  'Hawke's Bay winery doubled in size last year.'  'The amount you can deduct, then, depends on whether or not the stock has increased in value during the period you have owned it.'  Other clear cases of Attributes involve NP's like size, quality, number, value that denote abstract attributes rather than events or classes of things.   '' The analysis is more complicated when an event-denoting noun phrase occurs as the subject and the sentence has no in-PP. In the simplest cases, where the Attribute is the number of occurrences of the event, the Attribute is usually left implicit, as in exx. 1 and 2, the Attribute below.  '(1)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(1--second FE layer)Accidents increased 20% to 345.' '(2) Attacks on civilians decreased over the last 4 months  DNI.'  In cases  like (1), we will tag the Attribute on the second layer below the Final_value label, as that FE makes it clear that the Attribute is simply cardinality. In cases like (2), we tag it as DNI because in context the hearer has to understand a particular Attribute rather than just some or any appropriate Attribute of the Item.  Note that the above pattern can be compared to cases involving tangible Items, where the Attribute may similarly be missing when the incidence or frequency of the Item is specified.  '(3) Woodland birds increasedto their highest level since 1990 DNI.'   A more complicated case involving event-denoting subjects is when the Attribute measured is not the incidence of the type of event specified but rather an Attribute of an event-participant. In (4), it is not the number of times that turbot was caught that has changed but the amount of fish caught.  '(4) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.' '(4-second FE layer) Turbot catches increased from around 100 tonnes in the 1960s to around 1,200 tonnes in the mid 1990s.'  (Note the 2nd layer annotation of the Attribute below the Initial_value and Final_value FEs, since they indicate that the Attribute is implicitly weight.)  Similarly, in (5), the report is (in context) about the total monetary value of the gifts, not about the number of donations made.  '(5)Overall Giving by Church Members increased  from 2000 to 2001'  As can be seen from the above examples, we consider the event nouns in uses such as (4) and (5) to also specify Items. Note that in cases like (4), we do not want to treat the subject NP \"turbot catches\" as an Attribute that includes information about the Item, since it would not make sense to restate (4) as follows:  '*Turbot increased in catches.'  Two more complications arise. First, certain nouns that do not, by their etymology, denote abstract attributes have a second sense in which they do denote an Attribute.  '(6) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.'   Under one reading, (6a), the population could be understood as referring to \"the people\", in which case the Attribute cardinality is understood as unexpressed, as in (1),  (2), and (3).  The Attribute could be overtly specified:  '(6a) The population of Smallville increased fourfold in size to 807.'  Under another reading, (6b), population is an Attribute that habitats or locations possess. In this case, the whole NP \"the population of Smallville\" is treated as the Attribute and on the second layer \"of Smallville\" is tagged as Item.   '(6b) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' '(6b-second FE layer) The population of Smallville increased fourfold to 807.' Support for the possibility of this second reading comes from the fact that you can also state the facts as in (6c).  '(6c) Smallville increased fourfold in population to 807.'   The last complication is that Initial_value expressions can also function as the subject, which superficially look like expressions of Attribute.  '(7) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.' '(7--second layer) The 1999 price had increased to $3400 by 2001.'  There is no Attribute \"1999 price\" here (though the concept is plausible in certain special statistical contexts where prices are indexed to prices of a particular year). (7) simply reports that the value of the price-Attribute changed from whatever it was in 1999 to the new value of $3400 by 2001. For sentence (7), Attribute would only be indicated as \"price\" on the 2nd layer. ",
    "Change_post-state": "The frame represents the result state of the Entity after event represented by the Undergo_change frame. The intial states of the Undergo_change frame Initial_quality and Initial_situation are also FEs of this frame. ",
    "Change_posture": "A Protagonist changes the overall position and posture of the body.  'Smithers leaned forward to grab the folder on the far side.'",
    "Change_resistance": "An Agent changes a Patient's ability to resist literal or figurative attack. This frame differs from Cause_change_of_strength only in that the Patient is restricted to acting as a defensive force, i.e., it can resist but not exert force.  'We bulwarked the castle against the oncoming horde.' ",
    "Change_tool": "An Agent changes Tools, from the Old_tool to a New_tool.  The Tools may include vehicles, services providers, or more proto-typical implements.  'If this happens one more time, we 're going to switch operating systems.'  'Stephen had to transfer five times by the time he got to Lincolnville. DNI.'",
    "Chaos": "The lexical units in this frame have to do with an Entity being in a State of order or disorder.  Often the Entity is unexpressed in this frame and is, therefore, marked as a null instantiation.   '' 'Soon the system was in total chaos.' '' 'Fifa had already fined the Brazilians a minor sum for crowd disorder.' '' 'He had a hammer and banged it against the walls to restore order but nobody took any notice of him. INI'",
    "Chatting": "A group of people (the Interlocutors or Interlocutor_1 and Interlocutor_2 together) have a conversation.  No person is construed as only a speaker or only an addressee. Rather, it is understood that both (or all) participants do some speaking and some listening--the process is understood to be symmetrical or reciprocal.  In this frame, the purpose of the conversation is generally social, rather than specifically to decide something or exchange information, or to quarrel (see Discussion and Quarreling).  'If you ain't got nothin' better to do, I 'd like to shoot the breeze with you for a couple.' 'We used to chat about everything.'",
    "Chemical-sense_description": "This  frame covers the descriptions of tastes and smells, and has one main frame element, Source. The frame element Sensory_attribute occurs mainly with the words taste, flavour, and smell.  'The almonds had a bitter taste.' 'The almonds are bitter.'",
    "Chemical_potency": "This frame contains words that describe how potent a chemical is.",
    "Choosing": "A Cognizer decides upon the Chosen (either an item or a course of action) out of a set of  Possibilities .  The Cognizer may have an Inherent_purpose or a Larger_purpose for the Chosen.  Often an Explanation, which serves as the basis of the choice, is given.  'The council picked you out of all the pilots available to head this mission.' 'No one would choose to live in such squalor.' 'If no judge was unanimously selected in the previous round, play rock-paper-scissors pairwise. CNI' ",
    "Circumscribed_existence": "An Entity is understood to be experienceable within a particular set of delimited Circumstances, which may be more narrowly expressed by a Time, Place.  'This type of behavior occurs in several primate mating rituals.' 'Craft beers have started to appear in grocery stores all over the country.'",
    "Citing": "A Defendant is officially summoned to appear in Court by an Authority (such as the police) based on certain Charges. Alternatively, there is often an option for the Defendant to pay a Fine (thereby admitting their guilt) instead of going to Court.   'The police had summonsed the wrong man. DNI'   'Since 1989 nearly a million summonses have been issued to people for not paying their water bills. CNI'   'The officer cited him for riding a bike without a light.'   Three related frames are Notification_of_charges, Entering_of_plea, and Fining.  This frame is distinguished from Notification_of_charges in that it typically deals with less serious Charges and/or offenses. It also involves more than just notifying the Defendant (Accused in the Notification_of_charges frame) of the Charges being brought against them; LUs in the Citing frame also require that the Defendant take some form of action (go to Court or pay a Fine). Similarly, Citing differs from Entering_of_plea because its scenario encompasses more than the latter; Citing involves steps both before and after the Defendant enters a Plea in answer to Charges. Finally, this frame differs from Fining since the Defendant (Payer in the Fining frame) does not necessarily end up paying a Fine. He or she may go to Court instead. ",
    "Claim_ownership": "A Claimant asserts his or her right to possession of a piece of Property (either real, such as land, or private).  The Claimant may be acting on the behalf of a Beneficiary.

'A Fort Worth man convicted of a robbery his brother later confessed to committing was granted clemency on December 20, 2002, by Governor Rick Perry.'   'Engel represented Robert Bacon, the first man Easley gave clemency in 2001. INI '  'Ohioans will receive a blow-by-blow account of arguments before the Ohio Parole Board on whether Cincinnatian John Byrd Jr. should be executed or granted clemency for a 1983 murder. CNI'",
    "Closure": "An Agent manipulates a Fastener to open or close a Containing_object (e.g. coat, jar).  Sometimes an Enclosed_region or a Container_portal may be expressed. Since the Manipulator is syntactically omissible, many verbs in this frame incorporate the Fastener.  'Mary closed her coat with a belt.' 'Mary closed her coat with one hand.' 'Mary buttoned her coat .'",
    "Clothing": "This frame refers to clothing and its characteristics,  including anything that people conventionally wear.  The Wearer wears a Garment that has a certain Style, is made of a certain Material, and can be otherwise characterized by a Descriptor.  In some cases, the Body_location (where the garment is worn) and Subregion of the clothing may also be specified.  'Claudia dressed in a dark green cotton DRESS clasped round her slender waist with a broad yellow belt , drank a cup of coffee and opened her neglected post .'",
    "Clothing_parts": "The Subparts of Clothing items worn by a Wearer and made of a certain Material.  The Subpart may itself have parts, which we label Subregion:  'The shirt features a long sleeve with shiny gold buttons.'",

    "Cognitive_connection": "A concept, Concept_1, is related causally or collocationally to another concept, Concept_2 by means of some evidence.  They may be related only under certain Circumstances or from a certain Point_of_view.  The two concepts may be expressed collectively as associated Concepts.  Any cognizer is deprofiled.  'Smoking is tied to cancer.'",
    "Cognitive_impact": "A Phenomenon (an external or cognitive event or situation) comes into the awareness of an Experiencer, resulting in a perceptually punctual change in the Experiencer's conception of the Phenomenon or entities and facts associated with it.  'Her walk struck me as odd.' ",
    "Coincidence": "A State_of_affairs (a state or event) either holds or occurs, and is presented as being causally independent of other (implicit) states or events that might otherwise have been expected to be causally related to the State_of_affairs. The Time or Place may also be mentioned.  'That they got the same answers is just a coincidence.'",
    "Collaboration": "Partner_1 and Partner_2 or a group of Partners  work together in some Undertaking. The Partners are taken to be of equal status even when expressed disjointly.

    "Collocation_image_schema": "A Profiled_region is specified as entirely or largely coinciding with that of a Ground.",
    "Colonization": "A group of Colonists from a Homeland migrate to and proceed to settle in a New_area. The New_area then becomes their permanent home. The New_area and Homeland are in some way construed as being part of the same organization or system. In the case of (people from) nation-states colonizing other areas, the colony and nation-state are considered a single political entity. In the extended sense of living things in general colonizing or settling a new area, the original Homeland must still inhabited by some of the same group. In this sense Colonization is distinct from migration or exodus.  'In the 7th century BC, Phoenicians colonized the eastern section of Libya.' 'In the 7th century BC, Phoenicians colonized the eastern section of Libya.' 'Finns colonized the land from the south some 2,000 to 4,000 years ago' 'If a colony from Britain was established in that large tract of Country, and if we were at war with Holland or Spain, we might very powerfully annoy either state from our new settlement.'  This frame also includes metaphorical uses involving animals or plants, or abstract domains such as ideas.  'Deciduous trees such as red alder subsequently colonized the logged area.'  'Conservatives don't get what the left gets, which is that the left has already colonized and converted whole university departments.'  'As the years progressed and adaptations occurred new species and subspecies began to populate the islands.'",
    "Color": "A Color serves as a landmark in color-space, either a point-like landmark (e.g. burnt sienna) or a broader region (e.g. blue).  Especially when the Color designates a broad region in color-space, it may be defined with a specific Type, further specified by comparison to the color of a Comparand, modified by a Color_qualifier, or evaluated with a Descriptor.  All color words are generally used to specify the color of some (physical) Entity. 'I really like that shade of blue.' 'The welts on his side had already turned an angry red.' 'The room was bathed in a soft pink light.' 'They promptly set up a zillion bright vermilion pavilions.' 'His face and hands were brown from a life spent in the bright sun of the fields.' ",
    "Color_qualities": "This frame contains words that describe specific aspects of a Color. The Degree to which the Color being discussed deviates from the prototype may be marked. The description may also target a specific Aspect of color.  'I love really pale yellows.'",

    "Come_together": "In this frame a group of Individuals meet to form a Configuration. The Individuals or the Configuration may be expressed as the external argument of the predicates in this frame. In this frame, it is ambiguous whether or not the Individuals intentionally come together.  In an alternative construal, a grammatically more prominent Party_1 congregates with a Party_2, expressed as an oblique phrase. If this asymmetric construal is chosen, Purpose relates only to Party_1. '' The congregating happens in a certain Place and at a certain Time. '' 'The crowd came together in the courtyard.' 'The architects amassed in the lobby.' ",
    "Coming_to_be": "An Entity comes into existence at a particular Place and Time which may take a certain Duration_of_endstate, have a Cause, or be formed from Components.  'Problems may arise whenever an S1 sophont enters the game.' 'Mountains sometimes form in as little as a million years.' 'A new paradigm emerged from the discussion of nuclear weapons.' 'New Plants form from the cut veins in two weeks.'",
    "Coming_to_believe": "A person (the Cognizer) comes to believe something (the Content), sometimes after a process of reasoning. This change in belief is usually initiated by a person or piece of Evidence. Occasionally words in this domain are accompanied by phrases expressing Topic, i.e. that which the mental Content is about.   'Based on the most recent census I have concluded that most Americans sleep too much.'     ",
    "Coming_up_with": "Words in this frame have to do with a Cognizer creating a new intellectual entity, the Idea. These words are similar to words of physical creation such as build and make, and in some cases may be understood as metaphorically based on such words. However, the Ideas in this frame are predominantly conceptual in nature.  Compare this frame with Achieving_first.  In that frame, the fact that the idea is new to society is emphasized, whereas Coming_up_with refers to an agentive Cognizer using mental effort to figure something out, without any implication of the impact of the idea.  'I 've been trying to come up with a plan .'  ",
    "Commemorative": "This frame describes a particular compounding construction (a pattern of coinage) by which more complex words can be created by joining an Honored_entity to a Dedicated_type to describe a particular Dedicated_entity which has been officially named for the Honored_entity.  The Dedicated_type and Honored_entity FEs each form part of the Lexical Units (annotated on the second FE layer), and the Dedicated_entity is the denotation of the whole.  Since each of the FEs is a part of the Lexical Unit, there is no assignment of Grammatical Function or Phrase Type.  The Dedicated_type should (in principle) also be annotated as a LU in a separate frame.  Targets are added opportunistically to this frame in the course of annotating other frames.  For example, the Day of Armistice Day should also be annotated in the Calendric_unit frame.  '1st layer:  Turn right at the Jefferson Building.' '2nd layer:  Turn right at the Jefferson Building.'",
    "Commerce_buy": "These are words describing a basic commercial transaction involving a Buyer and a Seller exchanging Money and Goods, taking the perspective of the Buyer.

    "Commerce_pay": "This frame involves Buyers paying Money for Goods.  In this frame the Money is the direct object, and is mapped to the theme of the transfer.  'I paid her $50 for a video game.'",
    "Commerce_scenario": "Commerce is a situation in which a Buyer and a Seller have agreed upon an exchange of Money and Goods (possibly after a negotiation), and then perform the exchange, optionally carrying it out with various kinds of direct payment or financing or the giving of change.    The Seller indicates their willingness to give the Goods in their possession to a Buyer who would give them some amount of Money.  The Seller may have already decided on the amount of money that they would require, in which case it is called the Asking price.    The Buyer also indicates their willingness to give an amount of money called an Offer to a Seller who would give them the Goods.    Normally the process is begun by the Seller.  The means by which the Seller indicates their wish to engage in an exchange are various, ranging from putting a price tag on an item on a store shelf, to advertizing, to communicating directly and specifically with a possible Buyer.  In some cases, however, the process may be initiated by the Buyer indicating to a possible Seller that they would like to make an exchange.  'buyer beware.'",
    "Commerce_sell": "These are words describing basic commercial transactions involving a buyer and a seller exchanging money and goods, taking the perspective of the seller.  The words vary individually in the patterns of frame element realization they allow. For example, the typical patterns for SELL: SELLER sells GOODS to BUYER for MONEY.  'Robin sold a car to Abby for $5,000.'",
    "Commercial_transaction": "These are words that describe basic commercial transactions involving a Buyer and a Seller who exchange Money and Goods.  The individual words vary in the frame element realization patterns. For example, the typical patterns for the verbs buy and sell are: BUYER buys GOODS from the SELLER for MONEY. SELLER sells GOODS to the BUYER for MONEY.  'His $20 transaction with Amazon.com for a new TV had been very smooth.'",
    "Commitment": "A Speaker makes a commitment to an Addressee to carry out some future action.  This may be an action desirable (as with promise) or not desirable (as with threaten) to the Addressee. Some of the words in this frame allow an Addressee to be expressed. 'You promised me you'd come to my graduation.' Other words cannot normally occur with an Addressee. 'Kim undertook to finish the project by June.'",
    "Committing_crime": "A Perpetrator (generally intentionally) commits a Crime, i.e. does something not permitted by the laws of society.  'They perpetrated a felony by substituting a lie for negotiations.'  'The suspect had allegedly committed the crime to gain the attention of a female celebrity.'",
    "Commonality": "This frame contains words that describe a set of individuals which possess some Commonality, generally a common attribute.  'Their common enemy was Britain.'",
    "Communicate_categorization": "A Speaker communicates a message stating an Item's membership in a Category, i.e., asserts that the Item has the defining characteristics of the Category. Alternatively, the message is conceived as communicated by a Medium.  'He depicted his involvement as merely peripheral.'  'The first half of the book portrays Bragg's mother as a beautiful and heartbroken woman'.",
    "Communication": "A Communicator conveys a Message to an Addressee; the Topic and Medium of the communication also may be expressed.  This frame includes no specification of the method of communication (speech, writing, gesture, etc.).  This frame and the frames that inherit the general Communication frame can add elaboration to the Medium in a variety of ways (in French, on the radio program, in a letter) or to the Manner of communication (babble, rant, shout, whisper). There are also frames related to Communication that either do not inherit all of the FEs of this frame or do not inherit them in a straightforward manner (such as Conversation, in which Communicator and Addressee alternate roles, and are often expressed by a single, plural NP).  'Let's hope it did n't have time to communicate any of its findings to its overlords.'  NB:  For many words in this domain (those which do not inherently ascribe cognitive/social processes to a Communicator, position a statement within a conversation, or specify Medium in detail), there is a metaphorical usage which maps Communication onto an alternate POV of Becoming_aware, with corresponding maps for frames related to Communication.  This metaphor is most felicitous with Means or Medium subjects, which are mapped onto the Evidence FE of Becoming_aware.  In many cases this metaphor maps Communication onto the Evidence frame, but not always.  Some words from the Communication domain are listed in the Evidence frame since they are deemed to be lexicalized.  'A flick of his gaze toward the doorway told me what he really wanted. (METAPHOR)' 'This painting really speaks to me. INI (MET) ' 'Putting his arm around her protectively achieved nothing but announcing to their captors their vulnerability. (MET)' 'It says a lot that he did n't come back. INI (MET) '",
    "Communication_manner": "The words in this frame describe Manners of verbal communication.  All of them can occur with quoted expressions.   'He slurred his confession.'",
    "Communication_means": "This frame concerns Communicators communicating with each other with the aid of a Means of communication such as a telephone.  'I faxed him a resume.'",
    "Communication_noise": "This frame contains words for types of noise which can be used to characterize verbal communication.  It inherits from Communication (possibly more specifically Communication_manner) and the Sound_emission frame (which simply characterizes basic sounds of whatever source, including those made by animals and inanimate objects).  As such, it involves a Speaker who produces noise and thus communicates a Message to an Addressee. '' '\"Don't treat me as a child!\" she cried scornfully.'  'A writer in the Town Planning Review trumpeted that train-sheds were now obsolete.'  'You know he yelled at Aunt Lou yesterday, because he slipped on that mat in the hall.'",
    "Communication_response": "This frame deals with a Speaker communicating a reply or response, a Message, to some prior communication or action, the Trigger.  '' 'The landlord has not yet replied in writing to the tenant objecting the proposed alterations.DNI'  '\"No, I do not agree with you,\" responded another officer to the CEO. DNI'",
    "Commutation": "An Executive_authority exchanges one penalty, the Original_punishment, for another less severe one, the New_punishment. The Offender is who received the Original_punishment is usually expressed as a modifier.  'On December 15, 1971, Governor Winfield Dunn conditionally commuted his sentence to twenty years.'  'On December 15, 1971, Governor Winfield Dunn conditionally commuted his sentence to twenty years.'  'She served about two years before President Carter commuted her sentence.' 'She served about two years before President Carter commuted her sentence.'",
    "Commutative_process": "LUs in this frame describe a commutative operation of arithmetic, e.g. addition and multiplication, involving two numbers, labeled Term1 and Term2 or, collectively, Terms. When referencing the process, the numbers can be vague and are often omitted through indefinite null instantiation. There may also be a Calculator who applies the operation.  'Add three to five.' 'Any kid knows addition. INI'",
    "Commutative_statement": "LUs in this frame describe a stative relationship between two numbers,Term1 and Term2 or, collectively, Terms, via a commutative arithmetic operation. The numbers are specifically expressed, along with the Result of the operation.  'The sum of two and three is five.' 'That's three times the amount I asked for!'",
    "Compatibility": "Item-1 and Item-2 are compatible with each other if they can exist or function together in some context without problems, conflict, or other undesirable situation.  The set of Item-1 and Item-2 may be expressed jointly as Items. The Degree to which the Items are compatible may also be indicated, as may be a Parameter along whose lines the Items are compatible. ' Make sure your site is compatible with any browser.' 'Our software applications  are compatible. ' ",
    "Competition": "This frame is concerned with the idea that people (Participant_1, Participant_2, or Participants) participate in an organized, rule-governed activity (the Competition) in order to achieve some advantageous outcome (often the Prize).  Rank and Score are different criteria by which the degree of achievement of the advantageous outcome is judged.  'He and I played tennis.' ",
    "Complaining": "A Complainer communicates their negative emotional reaction to some state of affairs in a Complaint to an Addressee. As an alternative to the specific Complaint, the Topic of the speaker's Complaint may be specified. Likewise, instead of (or in addition to) the Complainer, a Medium may be stated.    'The top US commander in Iraq complained to the Pentagon last winter that his supply situation was so poor that it threatened Army troops' ability to fight.'   'He said he will lodge a complaint with the ACCC. DNI'  'On the rare occasions I complained to him about media bias, Peter immediately ordered up a story that included conservative objections to mainstream reports .'  'The Op-Eds were full of gripes about the recent tax hike.'",
    "Completeness": "A Whole, an entity with a substructure, is assessed for whether or not it has all the necessary parts that are defined for it or for an entity of its kind. The entity can be a concrete physical thing, an abstract thing, or a process with goals or sub-goals.    'What happens after the PPB investigation is complete? '  'Enter the number of days since the last complete backup was made.'  'This distinguishes them from organisms in the phylum Platyhelminthes, who have only an incomplete digestive tract.'  'Auditors should also assess the accuracy and completeness of the systems and data.'  'We now have an almost complete understanding of the model'  When the entity is a process with a goal, then what is assessed for completeness can either be the extent to which all candidate participants are involved in or affected by the process, or the stage that the process has reached. Thus the last of the above examples can either mean that all parts of the model are understood or that the model is fully understood as opposed to, for  instance, merely intuitively apprehended.",
    "Compliance": "This frame concerns Acts and State_of_Affairs for which Protagonists are responsible and which either follow or violate some set of rules  or Norms. '' 'A lot of people suspect that blocking savers' access to their money violates the new constitution's explicit ban on compulsory loans to the government.'  'Not that by adhering to the subject-before-predicate principle, the translator of the above extract has had to ignore the principle of end-weight.'",
    "Concessive": "A speaker marks a Conceded_state_of_affairs as being or implying a contradiction to the Main_assertion.  Some LUs specify the Main_assertion, others the Conceded_state_of_affairs, as referring to the preceding discourse (i.e. DNI), while yet others are conjunctions joining the two.  'Although she had some trouble , she was able to finish about two hours early .' 'Nevertheless , we did win . DNI ' 'I wanted to come , but I did n't remember where the party was . '",
    "Condition_symptom_relation": "A Patient has a Medical_condition that can be understood by its Symptoms. This frame has been constructed to list all the ways to speak of relating a Patient, a Medical_condition, and Symptoms, including LUs that are also related to much more general frames like Causation (e.g. cause.v).  ' Neurally mediated syncope is thethe most common cause of syncope.'  'Tietze Syndrome and Costochondritis Tietze syndrome manifested by painful swelling of one or more costochondral articulations'",
    "Conditional_occurrence": "A Consequence is presented as occurring if the Profiled_possibility occurs.  See Conditional_scenario for further information.    'If you take too long , the train will leave without you .'",
    "Conditional_scenario": "In this scene, two mutually exclusive possibilities are presented, the Profiled_possibility and the Opposite_possibility, each of which has a consequence associated with it, the Consequence (associated with the Profiled_possibility) and the Anti_consequence (associated with the Opposite_possibility).  Usually, the Consequence and Anti_consequence are also mutually exclusive, but in some cases (especially with \"even if\") the same Consequence results regardless of whether one considers the Profiled_possibility or the Opposite_possibility. Neither of the possibilities is asserted and neither can simply be merged with a factual understanding of the world. Both possibilities are presented as uncertain, and the Profiled_possibility may be further characterized with a neutral stance towards it, or with a doubtful, negative stance, depending on the specific lexical unit introducing the conditional and what verb forms are used in the Profiled_possibility. ''  'If you read caerfully, you 'll see the letters are swapped.' 'Unless you read carefully , you wo n't understand what I said .'  The most common use of lexical units connected to the Conditional_scenario is for prediction; in this case the conditionals pair up possibilities with predicted consequences. Subtypes of this use include, but are not limited to:  '' (1) contingencies:   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.'  (2) conditional promises (usually when making a deal): 'If you will wait with reasonable patience , I will explain'  (3) threats (which are inherently conditional):  'If any boy says anything to Weeks about it, I will cane him.'  (4) hypotheticals, especially when a different choice was made in the past and one imagines it would lead to a different outcome: 'If I had elected to stay there, I probably would not have become homeless five years later.'  (5) descriptions of general rules of the world: 'You only get shingles if you have had chickenpox.'  (6) descriptions of the characteristics of individual entities or persons that have an effect under certain circumstances: 'If Joey says you're in, you're in.'  '' Speech act conditionals: '' Lexical units of these frames can also be used in a pattern called a \"Speech Act conditional\".  In this case, the conditional presents a statement that is relevant to the conversation if the Profiled_possibility holds.   'Just ask for Bob if you need anything.'  The relevance of the statement is a Consequence of the Profiled_possibility, but there is no distinct alternative intended, so this usage does not normally allow distancing verb forms (see Dancygier and Sweetser 2005: 114-115). As shown in the above example, we annotate the potentially relevant statement as Consequence.  This is based on an analysis of the filler of the Consequence as metonymically expressing a message similar to \"it is relevant to say the following: ...\".  Such cases should be tagged with the clause-level tag \"Speech act\".  Thus in the following example, it is relevant for the speaker to explain the situation by saying \"no, she's not my wife\" if the other person is wondering about that possibility:  'In case you're wondering, no she's not my wife.' '' Metalinguistic conditionals: '' In addition, conditionals can be used to talk about the actual encoding of a message and usually encode a strong opinion about the appropriateness or inappropriateness of a description, often in contrast to someone else's contrary opinion. Such sentences should be tagged \"Metalinguistic\", as in the following:  'If that's not success, I don't know what is.' '' Epistemic conditionals: '' Finally, conditionals can be used to profile a reasoning process.  While all conditionals mark the connection from a hypothetical situation to an associated conclusion, many conditionals specifically highlight this process of thinking about the connection, especially when the reasoning is cooccurring with speaking, and most obviously when reasoning from effects to causes. In such cases as the following, we mark the clause as \"Epistemic\":  'If the lights are on, then somebody is home.'  Many sentences are vague about exactly to what degree they profile the reasoning process, so sentences like the following can be legitimately labeled \"Epistemic\" or not:  'If you believe that what you are doing is right then you can't compromise.'  '' Special constructions: '' Conditionals interact significantly with ellipsis constructions, particularly because they often occur in parallel structures in which different possibilities are being contrasted, or cases in which there is a contrast between what is always true and what is only conditionally true.  In these cases, the Profiled_possibility and the Consequence or Anti_consequence may be abbreviated under the same conditions that apply to ellipsis in the rest of the language.  See the following examples:  'She would visit for at least a week and, if necessary, an additional day or two.'  In these examples, \"an additional day or two\" is understood as \"she would stay an additional day or two\", based on the immediately preceding sentence.  This is a general construction that allows a finite sentence that is parallel to an immediately adjacent clause to be abbreviated just to the content in addition to or contrasting with the adjacent clause. Since it must be interpreted as a full clause and occurs in exactly the places a clause is expected, we actually annotate the PT of the Consequence as \"Sfin\" in these cases. The adjective \"necessary\" in the Profiled_possibility, however, is not licensed by a general construction that allows an adjective like necessary to be used arbitrarily in the kinds of places a clause would be found. Therefore, in this case, we consider the adjective to represent a separate valence with PT \"AP\".",
    "Conduct": "An Agent acts in a certain Manner either generally or under some particular Circumstances. The conduct may also be directed specifically towards an Affected_party.

Often this non-canonical state is undesirable, and some lexical units (marked with the Negative semantic type) specifically indicate that the Patient is negatively affected.  Some lexical units of this frame indicate by what means the Patient is altered (e.g., scrape.v) and in some cases give some indication of the detailed effect on the Patient (e.g., score.v, chip.v), and in other cases, both are specified (tear.v). For another set of lexical units, the action and its result are much less specified (e.g., damage.v).  Compare this frame with Destroying, Cause_to_fragment, and Render_nonfunctional.

    "Deception_success": "A Deceiver successfully causes a Victim to end up with incorrect beliefs about a Topic. The Victim comes to these beliefs from perceiving a Deception.",
    "Deciding": "A Cognizer makes a Decision, which may be about an entity or a course of action.  How (and whether) this frame is distinct from Choosing is currently up for debate.  'Mo decided to quit the program.' ",
    "Defending": "A Defender responds to an Assailant's attack on a Victim by directly, and usually violently, countering it.  'Samantha stalwartly defended the gateway from the wraiths, crouching low over Stephen's prone form.'",
    "Degree": "LUs in this frame modify a gradable attribute and describe intensities at the extreme positions on a scale.  'She is very brave.'  'It is that simple!'  'The feuds are so vicious because the stakes are so low.'  'The plant is totally red  without the slightest hint of green.' ",
    "Degree_of_processing": "A Material has been processed (generally industrially) to some Degree in order to make it more useful for some (usually implicit) function.  In some cases, an Alterant is used to process the Material.  ''",
    "Delimitation_of_diversity": "An Item which encompasses characteristics or types whose diversity is indicated by adducing a Limit1 and a Limit2 which differ considerably from each other.  In some cases, the Limit2 and Limit1 are construed together as Limits.  Alternatively, the values of a particular Variable for the Item and its Limits may be profiled.  'Prices range from 10 to 20 dollars.' 'Prices range from 10 to 20 dollars.'",
    "Delimited_state_scenario": "A State (often an ongoing process) is ongoing for some period of time.",
    "Delivery": "A Deliverer hands off a Theme to a Recipient or (more indirectly) a Goal location, which is accessible to the Recipient.    'The staff of Ebags delivered the umbrella well ahead of schedule.'  'In each class a dove flew in and delivered a red rose to Ginny.'  'The Pontifical Delegation for the delivery of the Icon of the Kazan Mother of God will arrive tomorrow. '",
    "Deny_or_grant_permission": "In this frame, an Authority allows a Protagonist to know (in some way) that they may or may not engage in an Action. For lexical units of this frame marked with the semantic type \"Negative\", e.g., authorize.v, the Authority has the power to tell the Protagonist not to do something, but does not do so. It is assumed that if the Protagonist engages in the Action without permission, then the Authority will punish the Protagonist in some way, at least with disapproval; if the Authority grants permission, however, the Authority is agreeing not to impose a punishment on the Protagonist for performing the Action.   'The police officer forbid me from turning around .' ' My mother okayed me to go to the movies with Simon . '   ' The teacher gave the children permission to eat their lunch outside. '  'The Church had sanctioned for recital after Mass a special prayer to St. Michael.'",
    "Departing": "An object (the Theme) moves away from a Source. The Source may be expressed or it may be understood from context, but its existence is always implied by the departing word itself.   'The plane leaves at seven.DNI.'  'His departure from the dock was delayed by hundreds of tearful farewells.'  'We all exited the room slowly.'",
    "Deserving": "The existence of a State_of_affairs is sufficient reason for taking an Action . The agent who is justified in taking the suggested Action is not part of the immediate scene, however.  'The underwater sequences warrant the price of the admission alone.'  ' 'Desperate situations call  for desperate measures ,\" said Mr Eames grandly.'",
    "Desirability": "This frame concerns an Evaluee being judged for its quality, i.e. how much it would probably be liked.  In many cases, the Evaluee is implicitly judged good or bad relative to other instances of its type. The Evaluee's desirability is determined by one or more Parameters, which are scalar properties of the Evaluee. The evaluation may also explicitly be relativized to a set of Circumstances, a Comparison_set of entities that belong to the same class as the Evaluee, or an Affected_party. The Degree of goodness or badness may also be expressed.  Note: With some targets, desirability is conventionally aligned with quantity, i.e., GOOD is MORE.  'The view was  astonishing.' 'On clear days, the view was excellent.' 'The book is astounding in its scope.' 'The games have been awful for the team.' ",
    "Desirable_event": "A particular State_of_affairs is desirable.  The State_of_affairs may be required to achieve a Purpose.  A set of Circumstances may be specified under which the assessment of desirability holds.   'You should take the doses about 12 hours apart and at the same time each day.' ' If the metal is seriously rusted or warped, it should be repaired or replaced with a chimney top damper.' 'To ensure that, you should have no CLASSPATH set.'",
    "Desiring": "An Experiencer desires that an Event occur.  (Note that commonly a resultant state of the Event will stand in for the Event.)  In some cases, the Experiencer is an active participant in the Event, and in such cases the Event itself is often not mentioned, but rather some Focal_participant which is subordinately involved in the Event. ''Generally, the use of a word in this frame implies that the specific Event has not yet happened, but that the Experiencer believes that they would be happier if it did.  Sometimes the Time_of_event, Purpose_of_event, or the Location_of_event are mentioned without the explicit mention of the Event. 'I only wanted one piece of candy.' 'The company was eager for him to leave as soon as possible.' 'Susan really wishes that you 'd listen to her.'",
    "Destiny": "An State_of_affairs will come to hold with respect to a Protagonist at some future time. The Protagonist is not conceived of as having control over whether the State_of_affairs will hold: obscurely related previous actions or circumstances, or some hidden power may have already determined that it will occur.  'Exile was his fate and he triumphantly turned it into the fruit of his life.'  'One could say that it was Indonesia's destiny to initiate the decolonization process.'  'The sun's ultimate fate is as a white dwarf, a dense, cold core the size of the earth.'  'At the time it did not appear that greatness was in her stars.'  'Nine for mortal men , doomed to die .'  'This seemingly predestined meeting between a creator and the model he has pursued all his life suggests a kind of miracle . ' ",
    "Destroying": "A Destroyer (a conscious entity) or Cause (an event, or an entity involved in such an event) affects the Patient negatively so that the Patient no longer exists.  'An asteroid obliterated the dinosaurs.'",
    "Detaching": "The Detaching frame covers two situations: a scene in which somebody causes one thing to be physically detached from something else; or a scene in which somebody causes two things to be disconnected from each other. In the first, the frame includes an Agent who detaches an Item from a Source, creating an asymmetric relationship between the Item and the Source. In the second, the Agent attaches two Items to each other, where each serves as a Source relative to the other, creating a symmetric relationship between the two Items. Note in both cases, after the removal of the connector, the Items that were formerly attached re-appear as the two separate or potentially separate entities that they were throughout.  'They finally unchained me from my desk at work and I'm leavin town.' 'Before adding a new area of color, he detached the canvas from the stretcher and laboriously scraped away the old paint in that spot.' 'She unhooked the leash from Patty's collar, and pulled her up on the couch.'",
    "Detaining": "The Authorities hold a Suspect under suspicion of having committed a crime (Charges). The Holding_location and period of detention (Duration) may also be specified. 'The police held Mr. Smith in the slammer on charges of killing his lawyer.'",
    "Detonate_explosive": "An Agent causes an Explosive device to explode.  'Who detonated that bomb?'",
    "Differentiation": "Words in this frame have to do with a Cognizer being aware (or not being aware) of the difference between two Phenomena, which may be expressed jointly or disjointly.      'It is very difficult for people to visually distinguish between living and non-living things from such a great distance .'  ",
    "Difficulty": "An Experiencer has an easy or difficult time carrying out an Activity. The ease or difficulty associated with the Activity seems to often be associated with a prominent participant. However, we consider this impression to be due to the syntax and pragmatics of the relevant sentence constructions and employ no special FE for such participants. The Degree of ease or difficulty is often specified as well as a set of Circumstances. A Parameter may be mentioned that indicates in which respect the Activity is judged to be easy or difficult. '' Unmarked LUs of this frame indicate that something is easy, while LUs of this frame that mean the opposite of easy are marked with the semantic type \"Negative\", as in difficult.a, arduous.a, and a bitch.n.    '(1) John is easy to please.' '(2) It is easy to get Alex annoyed.' '(3) Smithers is very tough for me to please.' '(4) VWs are easy to repair.' '(5) The dating of western sculpture is difficult.' '(6) In that kind of wind the course is physically very tricky.' '(7) The last question on the exam was hard. ' '(8) The last one was a hard question to answer. '",
    "Dimension": "This frame concerns  words that express an Object's position on a scale, its Measurement, with respect to some attribute, its Dimension.  Location,  identifying the sub-region of the Object where the Dimension is measured, may also be expressed.  'The tower is 10 feet tall.'   'The  new vase is 5 cm in circumference at the top.'  Adjectives in this frame must appear with a measurement expression like 5 cm.  Note the tagging of  six feet on the GF and PT layers in the following sentence.  'The woman was six feet tall.'  The GF of six feet is Dep and the PT is NP.",
    "Direction": "This frame covers the basic uses of direction words like the adverbs east, up, and forward.  These are used either to talk about a direction of facing (e.g., facing outward, pointing left, looking downward, turn east) or to talk about actual or metaphorical motion (went up, traveling due north).  Lexical units of this frame typically have a semantic type that refers to the means of determining the direction (e.g. forward.adv has the semantic type Landmark_front, meaning that \"forward\" is defined with respect to the direction from the center of some entity to its front, however defined).  Nevertheless, some words like way.n are used exactly when normal means of specifying direction are not available.  This frame is most frequently used to describe the motion of something along the Path from the Landmark, which is normally implicitly identified as the location of the viewpoint:    'We went north . DNI'  In such cases, a Distance from the Landmark can also be given:  'After she was knocked on the head , it seemed like everything had moved three feet to the left . DNI'  It can often be used for direction of facing, which is not compatible with the Distance frame element:  'Look left and you 'll see it . DNI '  Although rare for certain lexical units (e.g., upward.adv), most words in this frame are commonly used in a fictive motion pattern to identify locations that can be reached by moving in the indicated way from the Landmark:  'The book was unreachable, 10 feet up on the shelf. DNI' 'East of Mt. Diablo the Sierras rise majestically above the Central Valley.'  ''  In this fictive motion case, the Domain and the Independent_variable are both spatial, and should be marked as metaphorical.  Note this differs from members of the Directional_locative_relation frame (e.g., above.prep), which can only be used for relative static positions, and not for facings or for directions of motion:  '??? The book faced above the door .' vs. 'The book faced upward .'  A potential point of confusion is that the Directional_locative_relation frame is also used for cases in which adverbs like east.adv, etc. are followed by \"of\", since such expressions can only be used of static relative positions and not facings:  '??? I faced east of the mountains .'  Another potential point of confusion is that nouns referring to directions can be used for facings if they are preceeded by the word \"to\".  Since this use of to.prep can be found with a broader class of words like side.n, we interpret this sense of to.prep as mapping relative postitions (belonging to the Directional_locative_relation frame) to true Directions, in the sense of this frame.  This applies to expressions like \"to the east\", as well as \"to both sides\" and \"to the rear\".  In the future, we may add these as multi-word members of the frame.  In the following case, the Domain is \"potency\" and the Independent_variable is, as usual, time; again, the example should be marked as metaphorical.  '' 'They decided to rerate the medication downward in potency .' ''  In mathematical terms, all of these uses can be understood as a Path, made up of a set of positions in some N-space Domain (by default spatial, or metaphorically, other domains), being determined as a function of a Landmark (which may be incorporated and is usually implicit) and some one-dimensional Independent_variable (time, or, metaphorically, other domains).  The Domain and/or the Independent_variable are normally incorporated in the basic definition of the target; thus, for example, up.adv, by default, indicates the Domain is space, and time is the Independent_variable. From a linguistic point of view, we consider these literal spatio-temporal uses to be basic, and other cases, where space is replaced by some other kind of quantity, is to be understood as metaphorical.",
    "Directional_locative_relation": "A Figure is located relative to a (presumably more easily located) Ground, asserting that the Figure lies (approximately) on line from the Ground whose direction is established by semantic types of the particular LUs.  'The plane landed 10 miles due north of Lake Travis in an empty field .' ",
    "Disaster_scenario": "This frame covers the large scenario for characterizing disasters, including the occurrence of particular types of disasters and the range of responses to disasters.",
    "Discussion": "Two (or more) people (the Interlocutors, also encodable as Interlocutor_1 and Interlocutor_2) talk to one another. No person is construed as only a speaker or only an addressee. Rather, it is understood that both (or all) participants do some speaking and some listening--the process is understood to be symmetrical or reciprocal.  This frame differs from the Chatting frame in that the Interlocutors have a particular question that they are attempting to decide or understand.  'I would rather discuss politics with anyone but him.'   'World leaders met to discuss global warming on the coldest day of the year.'",
    "Disembarking": "A Traveller leaves from or dismounts a Vehicle.  'The passengers disembarked in Southampton.'  'They then informed the passengers that, if the aircraft were to leave the runway, they would likely be deplaning through the rear cabin doors.'",
    "Disgraceful_situation": "An implicit cognizer judges that a particular State_of_affairs for which a Protagonist is responsible is socially unacceptable.  'He called it a disgraceful situation. INI'  'To my mind it was undoubtedly the most utterly shameful act the chess world had witnessed since 1485. INI'  'It is not at all shameful for a man to allow himself to be ruled by others.'  ' We are grateful to Mr. Mattick for bringing this disgraceful building and its vile nuisance to the attention of the Henley District . INI'  'That comparison is shameful because it is comparing apples and oranges. INI'",
    "Dispersal": "An Agent or a Cause disperses or scatters Individuals from the Source,a relatively confined space, to a the Goal_area, a broader space.  'She scattered his ashes in the bay.'",
    "Distant_operated_IED": "A improvised explosive device, the Bomb, is rigged to detonate when it receives a signal, typically by a wire that leads to a trigger. The trigger may be operated directly by the Detonator, in which case the weapon is known as a CWIED (command wire IED). Or, the triggering mechanism may be activated wirelessly, such as by a cell phone. In this case, the weapon is called an RCIED (remote control IED).  'These photographs were taken in the wake of a CWIED attack on the British.'  'The purpose of this device is to prevent an RCIED from detonating.'",
    "Distinctiveness": "A Feature of an Entity serves to distinguish the Entity from other members of its type which have a different value for the Feature.  Note that the Entity is often implicit.  'His distinctive flowing gait and skill with the rapier set him apart from his fellows.' 'The swinging axe-kick was characteristic of Xena.' ",
    "Distributed_abundance": "There is a Location and an abundant or large Theme.  The Location and Theme are largely coextensive, i.e. occupying the same area.",
    "Distributed_position": "This frame involves a static (primarily spatial) relationship between a Location and a Theme, in which the Theme is located in many or all subregions of the Location, and is thus construable as covering it. The Time when the covering configuration holds, and the Subregion of the Location that is involved may, optionally, be indicated.    'By Summer, weeds dotted the field .' 'The papers around my office were too messy .' Prepositional and verb targets of this frame differ in the ways they can participate in forming sentences; one of the most important differences is that prepositions may modify the entire sentence to describe the event (the Theme) as distributed over the Location. 'Puddles were rippling all over the roof .'  Some members of this frame specifically indicate that the configuration is attractive or unattractive; this is indicated by the semantic types Positive_judgement and Negative_judgement respectively.  Some of the non-verb LUs of the frame (esp. around.prep) refer to multiple possible positions that might be occupied by a single Theme, often accompanied by \"somewhere\":  'I hope my wallet is around here (somewhere) .'  These same LUs may refer a vague sequence of locations occupied by a single Theme:  'I kept walking around my apartment .'  All or virtually all of the verbs used statically in this frame can also occur in the frame Filling, producing pairs such as the following:  'Filling: Pat covered the table with flowers.'  'Distributed_position: Flowers covered the table.'  '' Please note: adorned, covered, etc are in the Abounding_with frame because of the point of view shift. '' 'The tree was studded all over with soft dark fruit.'",
    "Diversity": "A Group is described as having members which are similar or dissimilar to each other.  The Degree of similarity may also be expressed.  Some of the nouns in this frame are transparent (e.g. range.n) whereas others denote the scale of diversity (diversity); variety.n is usable both ways but is normally transparent.  'The diversity of students here is to be applauded . INI' 'A range of answers were proposed .'  ",
    "Documents": "Words in the frame refer to any Document that has a legal status or conventional social significance.  Some Documents empower the Bearer of the Document to execute the Right.  Others indicate the Obligation of the Bearer.  Still others show the identity or Status of the Bearer.  'They got their marriage licence from Canada.'",
    "Dodging": "A Dodger acts to avoid an oncoming moving Bad_entity. 'Mo dodged  the flower pot that Larry threw in disgust.'  The motion is relative, since the Dodger may be moving. 'Jogging through the dense woods, Mo dodged the low branches .'",
    "Domain": "A Predicate  is said to apply in a particular Domain. The understanding of the relation between Domain and Predicate  depends on the nature of the Predicate. When the Predicate is a complete proposition, then a Domain adverbial also functions as a topic restrictor. Sentences with topic restrictors often come in pairs.  When the Predicate is a simple predicate, there is no notion of topic restriction on the sentence level.   'The Normal College is geographically adjacent to the University of North Wales.' 'Geographically, Britain is a group of island off the mainland of Europe.  Culturally , it has always been linked to the continent .'  'Socially and demographically the period has been dominated by two factors -- the fall in the size of families and the increase in the expectation of survival to retirement , the effects of which are still far from having exhausted themselves .'",
    "Dominate_competitor": "An Agent, by virtue of strength or forcefulness, controls, rules, or strongly influences some Patient in some Situation.  'The fireballing righthander looked poised to dominate the Yankees yet again, striking out seven straight batters during one stretch'",
    "Dominate_situation": "An Agent acts so as to be the strongest force, or most important causal factor in some Situation, to the exclusion of other competing actors.  'York dominated the game as they held the ball on offense almost the entire 70 minutes.' 'Is there a future for Unix in a market increasingly dominated by Microsoft?' 'Walz dominated the debate so completely it was almost embarrassing.'",
    "Domination": "An Agent has a influential, controlling position in a Situation, and is the primary causal factor in the development of the Situation, leaving other Competitors unable to take controlling positions.  Two perspectives are taken on this frame, one where the Agent is viewed as controlling primarily the Situation, and another where the Agent is viewed as primarily influencing the other Competitors in the Situation.",
    "Dough_rising": "The LUs of this frame describe a lump of Dough expanding as gas develops inside it.  This is part of a process where, in order to produce a lighter, more easily chewed bread, Dough is leavened with yeast, baking soda or in another fashion to add gas to it before baking.    'I've got no frozen boxed meals, and no other real options to make something to keep me going while my pizza dough rises.'",
    "Downing": "An Agent disables a flying or floating Patient, causing it to be unable to support itself in its current medium.  'It's rumored that she downed a helicopter with a precisely fired arrow.'",
    "Dressing": "A Wearer puts on an item of Clothing, which then occupies the Body_location.  'You didn't have to dress like a pirate to impress me. INI' 'He put on his thickest pair of gloves and then went back out to see if he could move them now. INI' 'Jack put on his watch - on his right wrist, and checked the time.'",
    "Drop_in_on": "A Visitor arrives at the Host_location as a guest of the Host, for the purpose of achieving a Purpose. The Purpose is often social in nature, i.e., the visit itself constitutes a goal.  'I'm gonna drop in on Kieth for a while.' ",
    "Dunking": "An Agent temporarily places a Theme into a Substance, often with the intention to remove it later. The Substance may be metonymically represented by its container. The Theme may be partially or completely submerged.  'She dunked her sandwich into some tomato soup.'",
    "Duplication": "This frame involves a Creator making a duplicate, the Copy, of some Original entity.  A Source, the location of the Original, and Goal, the location of the Copy, may be expressed.   'The teacher copied the problem onto the blackboard.'  ' His handouts were poorly photocopied  by his assistantfrom my originals .'",
    "Duration_description": "An event or state (here termed an Eventuality) or time-Period is described in terms of the Degree to which its duration diverges from a standard.  As is usual for gradable attributes, the standard of comparison is normally based on the expected duration for the type of Eventuality or Period.  (In conjunction with the comparative construction, the standard may also be based upon an explicit value.) '' 'After a lengthy discussion with the Foreign Minister, Mr. Qian Qichen, they met the Prime Minister.' '' 'The lengthy period which most party leaders have already spent in Parliament before gaining office certainly gives them time to acquire suitable skills.'",
    "Duration_relation": "A Period or Eventuality is related to its Duration.  Alternatively, an Entity may stand in metonymically for an Eventuality that it is involved in.  'You wouldn't last five minutes!'",
    "Duration_scenario": "An Event or Period has a particular Duration.  The Duration may be characterized in several different ways: as a Durational direct measure, a Degree of deviation from an expected Duration, or as a Count of Units of standard, known duration.",
    "Dying": "A Protagonist is near or approaching death.  'But a dying patient is still a living patient.'   ",
    "Dynamic_situation_scenario": "This frame denotes simple Events in which an Entity is in a dynamic situation, usually punctually or continually changing to conform to the situation encoded in the Event_endstate.  This frame also covers situations in which there is no significant difference between the pre- and post-states, but the dynamic situation that occurs between them is notably temporally bounded.",
    "Dynamism": "A physical Exerter, Action, or Force exerts energy at a level specified by the target. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses (\"an INTENSE person\") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses (\"an INTENSE look\"), although the individual-level meaning seems more basic.   'Although an energetic and able warrior, Charlemagne tended to direct battles rather than fight in person.' 'She dumped a mug on the bedside table with such vigor that steaming coffee spashed out.' 'Swing the racket with dynamic force.'   'I felt particularly sluggish at work that day.' Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set.  '' This frame also covers several productive metaphor cases. In the first one, movement or change caused by a social entity is conveyed as energy exerted by a physical entity. 'Social' here encompasses entities that are economic, political, technological, historical, cultural, and intimate: 'The private sector is so much more dynamic.' 'Singh had been under intense political pressure.' 'Economies are still sluggish.' Relatedly, the influential effect of an psychological entity is described in terms of energy exertion by a physical entity. 'Psychological' includes the intellectual, emotional, and creative: 'Sinead's emotional intensity permeates every nuance of every lyric.' 'He finds the Poet Laureate's theory about Shakespeare to be more energetic than persuasive.' Both metaphors appear to involve a third metaphor, which is the anthropomorphization of processes (see examples directly above) or inhuman entities (e.g. in nature): 'The lazy creak of sails' 'The energetic waves' 'A broad, lethargic river'  Further, there is a metonymy wherein energy exerted by people carrying out an activity characterizes instead a central object or other component of the activity: 'Lucker plays lazy games.' 'She thought the lazy days in France would never end.'  '' Compare to: Level_of_force_exertion. ",
    "Earnings_and_losses": "An Earner receives Earnings by providing Goods to a Buyer; providing the Goods also generally entails a cost, which may or may not be included in the consideration.  This frame emphasizes the effect on the Earner and often generalizes across an indefinite number of transactions with various parties.  Some of the LUs (e.g. earn.v) primarily refer to the to the Earnings without reference to cost, others to the amount the Earnings differ from the cost, emphasizing either a net loss (e.g. loss.n) or net gain (e.g. net.n).  'This reflects the 15 % jump in earnings over 1994 .' 'We made nearly two million on resales alone last year .' 'After a $ 1.5 million loss , the company is in no state to continue .'",
    "Eclipse": "An Obstruction blocks an Eclipsed entity partially or completely from view. The positions of the Obstruction and the Eclipsed entity are often reported relative to a Vantage_point.  'A small green bulb concealed behind the panel flashed on momentarily .'",
    "Economy": "A Political_region, often a nation,  has an economic system, theEconomy, defined by the level of production and consumption of goods and services.  The Market_type or Domain may be specified.  'The Canadian economy will continue to expand in 2005.' 'Medical industry is a new force in the industrial economy of Lin'an.'",
    "Education_teaching": "This frame contains words referring to teaching and the participants in teaching.  A Student comes to learn either about a Subject; a Skill; a Precept; or a Fact as a result of instruction by a Teacher.  Some of the nouns (schoolmaster, -mistress) in this frame refer to administrative positions and do not take relevant frame elements; these will be moved.    'Dad taught <fex name=\"\">me that if you work hard, you will be OK - no matter what happens. '  'What Our Cat  taught Me  About Marketing!'  'For two years she taught me French'  'Mom and Dad taught me not to bullshit, because it always came back to bite me in the ass, without fail. '  'A young swiss girl up in a swiss chalet taught me how to yodel.'  'Young Murdock later met a blind martial arts master known as Stick, who taught him how to use his augmented senses and trained him as a fighter.'  ' Maria, a woman studying to be a nun is sent from her convent to be the governess of the seven children of a widowed naval captain '  Frame-Element relations:  Several Frame element relations hold in this frame. There is a core-set {Material, Teacher} (possibly also including Institution); these FE's can fill the subject slot of the teach-type verbs. There is another core-set  {Precept, Subject, Skill, Fact, Role} to do with what is learnt. In addition, the FE Qualification may occur with Subject and Role  'My sister is studying for a maths degree    to be a teacher ' 'She's studying maths to be a teacher .'  Phrases expressing Qualification also very often include information about the Subject (see below), which is to be annotated on the second layer.  'Bill is studying for a BS in physics/a maths degree.' 'Bill is studying for a BS in physics/a maths degree.'  ",
    "Electricity": "Lexical units in this frame refer to Electricity, in particular as a form of energy harnessed for particular uses (such as powering machines).  The Source of the Electricity may also be expressed, or incorporated in the meaning of the LUs.  'A compound to generate wind electricity was built on the other side of those mountains.'  'China's hydroelectric dam is being built primarily for flood control and energy production.'",
    "Elusive_goal": "An Experiencer does not achieve a Desired_goal. Typically, the Experiencer is the object of the verb.  Metaphorically, a pursued entity is not captured.  'Success eludes me.' 'His point escaped  the entire audience.' 'A simple truth has evaded so many of us.' '' This frame is a metaphorical extension of the Evading frame.  The Evading frame concerns literal motion of two self-directed entities, one of which moves in such a way as to successfully prevent the other from capturing it.  In the case of the Elusive_goal frame, however, there is no literal motion, but rather a Desired_goal that is not \"captured\" by the Experiencer that would like the Desired_goal to be true or known.",
    "Emanating": "In this frame an Emission emanates from a Source along a Path or to a Goal.  'The light emanates from the tower.'  ' The uranium particles radiate from the nuclear plant . '",
    "Emergency": "This frame characterizes the situation or state of affairs in which someone should or must act to prevent a Undesirable_event from occurring. Often, an Entity affected by the Undesirable_event is more salient than the event itself and is mentioned in its place.  'Jo had a peanut butter chocolate candy emergency.'",
    "Emergency_fire": "A fire which burns and requires an emergency-type response.",
    "Emitting": "In this frame a Source_emitter discharges its Emission along a Path or to a Goal.  ' (1) The factory exudes toxic fumes from three large chimneys.'  The Sub-source is only present when the actual Source_emitter is also given or is present in a possessive.  ' (2) Light is emitted  from the tower . '  ' (3) Noxious odors are emitted from his feet . '  In (3) we would tag 'his' as Source_emitter on a second layer because the inalienable possession on the Sub-source indicates the Source_emitter",
    "Emotion_active": "This frame has similarities to Experiencer_subject, but here the verbs are more 'active' in meaning. (For example, they often occur in negative imperatives, e.g. \"Don't worry!'').  They also differ from Experiencer_subject verbs in that they occur with Topic expressions and  can be used in the present progressive:  'Pat is still worrying about the exam.'  *Pat is fearing the exam. This frame can be thought of as a blend of a basic emotion frame with Cogitation. ",

    "Emotions": "An Experiencer has a particular emotional State, which may be described in terms of a specific Stimulus that provokes it, or a Topic which categorizes the kind of Stimulus.  Rather than expressing the Experiencer directly, it may (metonymically) have in its place a particular Event (with participants who are Experiencers of the emotion) or an Expressor (a body-part of gesture which would give an indication of the Experiencer's state to an external observer).",

    "Employment_scenario": "An Employee and Employer enter into an employment relation, wherein the Employee remains employed for some Duration of time, and finally the relationship ends either by the Employee leaving the job or the Employer letting go (or firing) the Employee.  To each of these events there are concomitants, such as agreeing to/signing a contract for entering employment, compensation and performance of a service for the employment period itself, and severance for the dissolution of the relationship.  There are several other events involved, including preparatory actions on the part of the Employer (posting the Position), the prospective Employee's part (looking for a job), or both (job interviews).  In addition, there is the possibility of change in the relationship of Employer and Employee during the employment period, such as a change in Position (e.g. promotion, demotion) and a change in Compensation (e.g. raise, paycut).",

    "Emptying": "These are words relating to emptying containers and clearing areas of some substance or items. The area or container can appear as the direct object with all these verbs, and is designated  Source because it is the source of motion of the Theme.

    "Endeavor_failure": "Some individual or group ceases to be able to sustain an Endeavor (a long-term activity involving economic interaction with the public, often a business venture).  Unlike Business_failure and Locale_closure, the Endeavor need not refer to an organization or business tied to a specific location or locations.  'Exxon went under.'",
    "Enforcing": "An Agent acts to ensure that a Rule (often a constraint on behavior) is being followed.

    "Estimated_value": "A Cognizer has carried out an approximate calculation or considered some Evidence and produced an approximation of the Value of a feature of an Item. There are two alternative construals in which the relationship between the feature and the Value is conceived. Either a holistic Estimation by the Cognizer is presented, or the Question that is addressed by the Cognizer's estimating is given.   'You can list a ballpark figure for shipping and handling.'  'Moreover, their estimate of 0.27 °C mean surface warming per century due to land-use changes is at least twice as high as previous estimates based on urbanization alone.'

    "Estimating": "A Cognizer carries out an approximate calculation or considers some Evidence so as to arrive at an approximate Value for some Feature of an Item.   There are two alternative construals. In one, the Feature is presented as a Question about the Item and the Value is conceived as an answer to the Question.  In the second construal,  a fully propositional Estimation by the Cognizer is presented which expresses the result of the Cognizer's approximation.  'Until 1971, dolphin mortality could be estimated only from analyses of vessels ' logbooks -- and the figures are probably underestimates.

    "Evading": "An Evader moves under its own power to thereby avoid Capture  or contact with a Pursuer, also generally moving under its own power. This frame characterizes a  more specific event  than Avoiding in that both the Evader and the Pursuer are moving entities.  In addition, this frame differs from Escaping by requiring a Pursuer and being neutral about the prior captivity of the Evader.  'I gave my handler the slip.'  'He evaded capture for several hours.'",
    "Evaluative_comparison": "This frame is about the static comparison of an Profiled_item to a Standard_item, often  with respect to some Attribute. In this frame, there is an inherent asymmetry between Profiled_item and Standard_item in that the two cannot be expressed jointly as a subject. Degree expressions are also found that indicate how close the items are to each other on the scale evoked by the Attribute. Furthermore, the particular value of the standard or item on a certain scale may be given by the Standard_attribute of the Profiled_attribute respectively.

    "Eventive_cognizer_affecting": "An Event causes the Cognizer to accept some Content.  Although the Cognizer forms an intention, it is not entailed that he/she acts.  'The divorce convinced him to get help.'  'The price of a factory reconditioned tool decided it for me.'",
    "Evidence": "The Support, a phenomenon or fact,  lends support to a claim or proposed course of action, the Proposition, where the Domain_of_relevance may also be expressed.

'They swapped the island with the Neapolitan government of the day for the much smaller Capri.' 'Then the teams swapped their draftees.' 'We exchanged addresses and he told us that next year when we are in Aruba we will visit with his family there. '   ''  Notice that this frame is to be differentiated from the Replacing frame, where there is no notion of trade between two parties and the focus is only on the relationship between two items that successively fulfill a function or participate in a relation. ",
    "Exchange_currency": "A Money_owner exchanges Sum_1 in the  Source_currency for Sum_2 in the Target_currency at some Exchange_service.  'After checking into the Intourist-operated $30-a-day Hotel Zerafshon, we each exchanged $50 for Uzbek currency with a shifty loiterer in the lobby at the rate .'

    "Execute_plan": "An Agent acts according to a <em>Plan</em>, carrying it out (or taking steps to carry it out). In some cases, the Agent is a focal participant in the Plan, although a separate Focal_participant may also be mentioned. The Plan may be specified for the Duration for which it is in effect.  'Health authorities say they have put measures into effect in all ports of entry and in centers of provinces.' 'Channing House has recently implemented a new dining program for residents on pureed diets.'  Note: the phrase <em>(put) in effect</em> is in the Being_in_effect frame.",

    "Existence": "An Entity is declared to exist, generally irrespective of its position or even the possibility of its position being specified. Time, Duration, Inherent_purpose, and State may also be mentioned.  This frame is to be contrasted with Presence, which describes the existence of an Entity in a particular (and salient) spacio-temporal context, and which also entails the presence of an observer who can detect the existence of the Entity in that context.  'Finally, Poland ceased to exist as a state for hundreds of years.' 'Such laws exist to prevent exactly this kind of fraud.' 'There IS a Santa Claus!'",
    "Expansion": "An Item changes its physical size.  The Size_change of an Item may be explicitly indicated or characterized in terms of Initial_size and/or Result_size.  In the default case, expansion is along all dimensions, but sometimes the Dimension of expansion is incorporated or made explicit. '' This frame does not specify whether the Item gains mass or substance along with the change in size, and thus includes words that specify an increase in substance (grow.v) along with those that deny an increase in substance (stretch.v) and those that are unspecified (expand.v).  'The pile of leaves had shrunk by about half after the first haul.'  'The jeans stretched a little.'",
    "Expectation": "Words in this frame have to do with a Cognizer believing that some Phenomenon will take place in the future.  Some words in the frame (e.g. foresee.v) indicate that the Phenomenon is asserted also to be true, while others do not.  'Michael expected Abby to demand examples.'

This event is often more specifically described as gaining possession of some Goods or receiving a Service.  In the majority of cases, the Payer is described generically (INI), and the situation depicted answers the question of how much of an Asset would have to be given up to receive the Goods or bring about the Intended_event.  'It 'll cost Sandra's parents fifty grand a year for her to attend that school. ' 'That book would cost you more than twenty dollars to bind <fex name=\"\">in a local book bindery.'

'He smacked his head on the mantel getting up from poking at the fire.'",
    "Experiencer_focus": "The words in this frame describe an Experiencer's emotions with respect to some Content. A Reason for the emotion may also be expressed.

' My enjoyment of the movie was considerably impaired by the seven-foot guy sitting in front of me. ' ' Smithers takes great pleasure in collecting matchboxes.' ' Sergio derives great pleasure  from  smoking.' ' Smoking gives me extreme pleasure.'

'Rolf tested his hypothesis in Vienna in 1973.'",
    "Expertise": "This frame concerns people's knowledge or skill in certain domains.  It does not concern acquaintance or familiarity with people.

    "Explaining_the_facts": "A Question about the reason or cause of a known State_of_affairs is presented as being answered by the existence of a particular Fact.  The exact chain of reasoning, including the answer itself, of which the Fact is a part is not specified.  Contrast this frame with the Evidence frame which casts a Support (a fact) as providing Evidence for, or conclusively proving, the Proposition (another proposed fact). Thus, there is no open question in the Evidence frame.   'Ruby's orange vest marked with the words \"service dog\" accounts for why the 3-year-old goes along.'

The Content may not have been previously communicated due to inability or social stricture.  In cases where the individuals addressed are a smaller group than the public at large, a separate Addressee may be expressed.  'Those grievances can be aired during Board meetings. CNI'  'Saddam voiced his joy when he was told Spain's new government had left the US-led military coalition in Iraq.'   ",

    "Extreme_point": "An Entity that has characteristics which change over time is at a point or in a phase of its development in which, compared to other actual or expected stages of development, it possesses extremely high or low powers or intensity.

'I dozed off at about 1am.'",
    "Fall_for": "A Victim comes to have incorrect beliefs as a result of exposure to a Deception. The Deception is necessarily orchestrated by one or more agents, though these are not expressible by the LUs in this frame.

    "Fame": "An Entity is well-known among a wide range of people (in general or in a particular domain) for a particular Reason, which may be a behavior, characteristic, or some other associated item. In the case of events, fame entails a large number of people being aware of the event's occurence; in the case of concrete entities, including humans, fame entails awareness of existence. In both cases, often fame is accompanied by awareness of the Entity's significance in historical, cultural, or social contexts.  'Shakespeare was famous during his life because he performed in front of Queen Elizabeth I more than anyone else.'",
    "Familiarity": "An Entity is presented as having been seen or experienced by a (typically generic and backgrounded) Cognizer on a certain number of occasions, causing the Entity to have a certain degree of recognizability for the Cognizer.

The Degree of divergence from the expected distance may also be expressed.  In addition to the asymmetrical consideration of Figure and Ground, these may be construed collectively as Figures, in which case each entity is assessed for how expected its distance is from others in the group of Figures. '' Productive metaphors include cases where the degree of closeness or intimacy between people/entities is conceptualized as gradable proximity (\"their close / distant relationship...\"). The directness of familial relations is also construed this way (\"a close / distant cousin\"). Other metaphors involve possibility - usually of more extreme events - as proximity (\"it was near collapse / extinction / disaster\") and of category fit as proximity (\"that was far from perfection / the truth / a miracle\").

The Phenomenon may be incorporated into the wider knowledge structure via categorization, which can be indicated by the mention of a Category. The Cognizer may possess knowledge only in part and this may be expressed in a Completeness expression. The Cognizer may also be realized as a cognitive-emotional Faculty that is conceived of as having understanding.

'It can be confusing if one word translates into several in Spanish, which don't have the same gender.'  'Therefore, this word translates as \"a male\".'  'Perak translates as \"silver\" in the Malay language.'

'We have just seen how each Bible program makes it easy to get a definition of the Greek or Hebrew word which a given English word translates. ' The difference is essentially between whether both speaker and addressee in the context where the word is used are starting with the Target_symbol in mind.  When they are, the symbols are being compared for how they correspond and Be_translation_equivalent can be used.  Otherwise, generally where the information conveyed by the predication is what the Target_symbol is, Have_as_translation_equivalent is used.",

'This blanket is too toasty for me.'",
    "Hedging": "When words of this frame are used as hedge markers, they signal that the speaker of the sentence wishes to be careful about asserting some Hedged_content.  Use of a hedge marker may mean that the speaker is uncertain of how factual of the Hedged_content is, or uncertain of whether they're expressing the idea behind Hedged_content well, or it may mean that the Hedged_content is socially undesirable or awkward in the conversational context.   'The president is a bit of an idiot when it comes to foreign policy .' 'I 'm sorry , but he is on the heavy side , you understand .' 'I thought, like, maybe you would know .' 'My father was something of a dilettante .' 'He rather doubts you'll be able to convince your mom. ' '' Because these words serve to indicate hesitancy, often for purposes of increased politeness, speakers may use several encodings of hedging simultaneously to iconically indicate the degree of politeness or hesitancy that they wish to express:  'Your story, is, like, kind of a bit on the short side .' '' There is also an ironic or sarcastic use of LUs in this frame, as in the following:  'When a standard vaccuum can't even pick up the clods, you know you've kinda got a problem.' '' Words expressing small quantities or degrees (e.g., \"a tad\", \"a little\", etc.) can be used in a very similar function to words of this frame.  However, these words do not simply signify hesitation, but merely frequently imply it when used to modify a predication.  Such words can only be used on their on or with a noun to signify a small quantity or number (\"a little whiskey\", see Proportional_quantity), or with an adjective to indicate that the quality described by the adjective is close to average (\"a mite stupid\", \"somewhat confused\" see Degree).  Words of those frames may be nested within noun phrases or in other positions where content is not asserted but rather presupposed.  Words that belong to the Hedging frame, by contrast, either take a noun complement and indicate hesitancy or imprecision concerning the category (\"something of a klutz\"), or modify an entire proposition to indicate imprecision of the proposition (\"I, like, waved it around\").  In both cases, the Hedged_content must occur in the at-issue focus of a proposition, the part of a statement that the speaker is, so to speak, on record as asserting.",

    "Hindering": "In this frame a Hindrance makes it more difficult for a Protagonist to complete their intended Action or a Hindrance directly affects an Action where the Action can be a natural act or the actions of many individuals in a collective endeavor.  Crucially, these lexical units do not entail that the Protagonist was unable to complete the Action or that the Action did not occur. The Hindrance may indicate a lack of enablement or an obstacle on the natural progression of the Protagonist or Action   ' Malcolm was hindered by his drinking problem .

'Dennis Andries's European cruiserweight title clash against Akim Tafer of France in Beausoleil last February has been voted as the EBU's fight of the year.'",
    "Hunting": "A Hunter tries to gain Food by way of outsmarting or tracking a living. The Hunter hopes the attempt will result in the catching and killing of the living entity that is intended for human consumption. The act of seeking Food inherently involves the assistance of some tool, which can be an extension of the Hunter's body or an artifact fashioned or exploited for the use of food seeking, catching, and/or killing.  'In the Congo, he hunted big game for the first time.'  'People still fish bass in the lake.'  'Folks from Northern California hunt brilliantly. INI ' ",
    "Hunting_scenario": "A Hunter endeavors to- and either fails or succeeds at finding and obtaining Food. This scenario occurs within the context of some Ground within which the preparation, hunt, and success or failure of it plays out. ",

    "Identicality": "A Current_instance of a certain Type is under discussion. This instance  is evaluated as being the same instance or a different instance from a Previous_instance encountered in a Previous_context.

'Is this the same sofa as the one that used to be in the lobby?'   'Dracula and your neighbor are different people' 'Dracula and your neighbor are different people'",
    "Identity": "An Instance of some type is conceived of as having an Identity, defined as the unique feature that distinguishes each Instance from all other instances of its type.  Identity persists across time and remains constant for an Instance despite arbitrary changes in other attributes of the Instance.  Establishing Identity answers the question \"which\".  'I still have questions about her identity .' 'Which dinner did you choose ?'  Identity is not the same as appearance or name (if the Instance even has such), although these attributes of the Instance may be useful in establishing Identity.  Identity can be established knowing the totality of the history of an Instance; however, this is impractical and usually proxies like name and appearance are used.  For the Identity of humans, history sufficient to establish Identity can usually be satisfactorily established by documents associated with the person, often with information like appearance and name, though use of such documents contributes to the problem of multiple identities, only one of which is considered legitimate or \"true\" in a given context.  Just as we would consider gun in \"fake gun\" to contain a reference to the normal concept of Weapon, we consider identity in \"multiple identities\" to belong to this frame, even if only one of the identities is legitimate.  Multiple identities can also exist when each is primarily associated with a fragment or aspect of the history and attributes of an entity, and the \"true\" identity might be very much debatable; in most such cases, there are different names associated with the different identities, as in the case of stage names or Ellis-Island names, but sometimes, the different \"identities\" go under the same name (e.g., some members of secret societies). While these may be considered different identities, they refer to the same person. '' This frame is intended to cover cases where an entity is mentioned, but the category it fits is what is actually meant:  'We need to determine the identity of the metal used in the picture frame .'  In this case, it is not individual identity of the physical hunk of metal that is intended to be in question, but rather the category that the hunk of metal fits into; i.e., the specific element or elemental composition of the metal is what is in question.  Such sentences should be understood as determining which Instance of the supercategory is intended.  '' This frame is not intended to cover related, and often more common, uses of the word \"identity\" such as \"sexual identity\", \"national identity\", or \"brand identity\", which do not refer to a unique identity of an Instance, or even the identity of a supercategory of the Instance, but rather refer to the specific properties of an Instance that are considered very important for how the Instance operates in aggregate.  Thus, uses like \"losing your identity\" are not intended to be covered by this frame.",
    "Identity_scenario": "An Instance of some Type is conceived of as having a distinct Identity.  Its Identity persists across time and remains constant for an Instance despite arbitrary changes in other attributes of the Instance.  Establishing Identity answers the question \"which\", and is often answered by saying that an Instance is the same or different from a previously mentioned instance (see Identicality), or by deictic reference (\"that one\"), etc.  Identity is not the same as appearance or name (if the Instance even has such), although these attributes of the Instance may be useful in establishing Identity.  Identity can be established knowing the totality of the history of an Instance; however, this is impractical and usually proxies like name and appearance are used.  For the Identity of humans, history sufficient to establish Identity can usually be satisfactorily established by documents associated with the person, often with information like appearance and name, though use of such documents leads to the problem of multiple identities, only one of which is considered legitimate or \"true\" in a given context.

Depending on the lexical unit, the Agent 's point of view may be centered on the Exporting_area at the beginning of the process (e.g. export) or on the Importing_area and the end of the process (e.g. import) or on the Path (e.g. transship). In some sentences, a constituent which encodes the Agent FE also encodes information about the Exporting_area, Path, or Importing_area.

    "Imposing_obligation": "A Duty is imposed on a Responsible_party according to a Principle which regulates how the Responsible_party should respond to a Situation.  The Situation may be expressed metonymically by reference to an Obligator, whose action invokes the Principle.  It is only rarely the case that the Principle and the Situation/Obligator are both expressed overtly.  'They escaped total Soviet invasion and occupation only by entering into a separate agreement that obligated them to military action against the retreating German armies.'

(Note that members of this frame marked with the semantic type \"Negative\" indicate deterioration.)  In most cases the Prior_state and the Post_state are implicit, since the most important fact is simply that the Post_state is better than the Prior_state.  'My typing speed is improving .'

    "Inhibit_movement": "An Agent restricts the movement of a Theme to within the vicinity of the Holding_location, despite the Theme's desire, plan, or tendency towards motion; the Agent may also use an Instrument. Alternatively, there may be a non-sentient Cause instead of an Agent restricting the Theme.  For many of these targets, the means is incorporated.  For some LUs, the Theme is required to be a sentient entity.  Several of these LUs may be used to describe punishment situations when the Theme is a sentient entity.    'They held the package for two months in the border-patrol locker room .'",

    "Interior_profile_relation": "A Figure is located in the interior (the Profiled_region--see Locative_relation frame) of the Ground. Some members of this frame indicate the plexity of the Ground, as either single-entity gestalt (inside), two-entity or bi-partite gestalt (between.prep), and multiple-entity or multipart gestalt (among.prep, amid.prep), while others are maximally general (in.prep).   ''  This frame makes use of the Bounded_region image schema, a way of partitioning a scene into an Interior, an Exterior, and a Boundary.  In some cases, the Boundary may be a physical entity that inhibits motion (\"in a box\"), while in other cases it may be based on a category boundary where properties change (\"in the garden\").  The LUs that specifically pick out two-entity or multi-entity Grounds imply the lack or irrelevancy of a physical barrier.  'The bookmark inside her book was torn and written on .' 'My keys were in the street .' 'Step back outside . CNI DNI ' 'She stood in a puddle and splashed desultorily .' 'I felt around inside the oven hood . CNI' 'They found the backpack and found a computer inside . DNI' 'Within the base , nobody knew the attack was about to hit .' 'We talked outside the office .' ''  This frame is intended to cover cases in which the Ground is a critical locus for the event.  (When annotating the main verb in such a case, the locative phrase may be annotated on a second layer as Means, Instrument, or Cause.) 'The pole snapped off in her hand .' 'She combed her hair between her fingers .' ''  In some very specific situations, a prepositional phrase can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following: 'Inside my wallet is where i put it .' 'Outside your blind date's door seems like the worst place in the world .' ''  As in other locative frames, the LUs interact productively with other lexical and non-lexical frames. One of the more confusing cases is with verbs involving gaze, in the which the Figure is specified by the governing verb to be the gaze of the viewer, and thus from the viewpoint of the locative LU is CNI. See the following: 'They looked among the trees for an hour . CNI' '' ''  This frame is used in several productive metaphor cases. One of the most frequent is the use of this frame to express an Entity (construed as a Figure) as a member of a category or state (construed as a Ground).  'Is the economy in recession ?' 'There are good or bad weather days here , and nothing in between . DNI ' ''  Another productive metaphor is referring to a mental entity or activity of a cognizer (construed as a Figure) as being located inside the cognizer or the cognizer's mind (construed as a Ground): 'You close your ears to the small voice within DNI' 'I felt an unease inside me .' 'It was as though a light had gone out somewhere inside of him .' 'I had inside of me this feeling that something was going to happen .' ''  The frame can be used to talk about a member (construed as a Figure) being part of a group (construed as a Ground): 'Then mingle the most gruesomest , grisliest ghost stories in among your jokes .' 'There are so many children in the family .' ''  Two uses of this frame are either productive or semi-productive, and we have annotated examples experimentally on the assumption that the metaphors may be productive: In the first and most common, Interior_profile_relation lexical units are used to describe the timing of events relative to other events or periods, with per target differentiation or homogeneity of the Ground events that serve as a reference, based on the literal use of a target: 'amid the confusion' 'inside the competition period' 'between lunch and dinner' However, some members of this frame require that a time be construed (e.g. with the word \"period\") while others can take events as Grounds directly. ''  In the second, some idea (construed as the Figure) is true in the context of a larger idea or text (construed as the Ground): 'In the paper , `` self-control '' is used to mean a sense of willpower .' 'Inside the world he created , hobbits run wild .' Again, the productivity of the this metaphor is uncertain because inside.prep, in among.prep, and some other members of this frame do not occur in this metaphor, or are strangely constrained and do not paraphrase similar examples with in.prep. '' ''  This frame should not be used for cases in which the Ground element is a literal or metaphorical distance; see Within_distance. ",

    "Judgment": "A Cognizer makes a judgment about an Evaluee. The judgment may be positive (e.g. respect) or negative (e.g. condemn), and this information is recorded in the semantic types Positive and Negative on the Lexical Units of this frame. There may be a specific Reason for the Cognizer's judgment, or there may be a capacity or Role in which the Evaluee is judged.  '' This frame is distinct from the Judgment_communication frame in that this frame does not involve the Cognizer communicating his or her judgment to an Addressee.   'JUDGMENT:  She admired Einstein for his character.' 'JUDGMENT_COMMUNICATION:  She accused Einstein of collusion.' '' Currently, however, some lexical units and annotation for both remain in this frame.",
    "Judgment_communication": "A Communicator communicates a judgment of an Evaluee to an Addressee.  The judgment may be positive (e.g. praise) or negative (e.g. criticize), and this is indicated by the semantic types Positive and Negative attached to the lexical units.  This frame does not contain words where Evaluee and the Addressee are necessarily the same .  'I commended his handling of the crisis.' 'Gaston denounced him to the committee.' This is distinct from the Judgment frame in that it involves the communication of an evaluation, rather than merely forming and holding a particular evaluation.",
    "Judgment_direct_address": "In this frame, a Communicator judges the Addressee and then communicates that appraisal directly to the Addressee. The judgment is given for a particular Reason or about a particular Topic.  'The principal rebuked the student for cheating on the exam.'",

    "Labor_product": "An Agent or a Cause mentally or physically expends energy rendering an Input, whether implicit or explicit, into a Output.  'Erosion is the work of wind and water on rock.'  NB:  The Input in the case of artistic Output, or an \" artistic work\" as more commonly referred to, is usually INI, because the material at hand being rendered is usually an idea or artistic material that is taken as common foreground knowledge by the semantics of the Agent's professional role.  'One of Chinua Achebe's greatest works was Things Fall Apart. INI'   ",
    "Launch_process": "An Agent acts to begin the life of a Process.  'After discovering her knack for organization, she decided to try to  launch a career in human resources.'  'The City of Bratislava has launched a pilot project of providing internet access in the city centre.'",
    "Law": "A Law regulates activities or states of affairs within a Jurisdiction, dictating what Required states should be the case and what Forbidden states should not.  Often it also indicates negative consequences for individuals that violate it, and these negative consequences are generally enforced by some official authority.  They may or may not be created by some official legislative body.  'The new act banning smoking in public will pass soon.'",
    "Law_enforcement_agency": "A law enforcement Agency is tasked by a government with guaranteeing compliance with the laws in a particular Jurisdiction.  'She works for the Oakland police.'",
    "Leadership": "These are words referring to control by a Leader over a particular entity  or group (the Governed) or an Activity. The frame contains both nouns referring to a title or position (e.g. director, king, president), and verbs describing the action of leadership (e.g. rule, reign). With verbs, it is possible to mention the Role played by the Leader (often a name of a leading position, e.g., king)  'Sebek em hat was a Leader of Priests. ca. 1780 BC' 'In 1789 Fletcher Christian led the mutiny on HMS Bounty' 'Louis XIV ruled over his people as king for the longest period of any European monarch.' Compare to: Appellations. ",
    "Leaving_traces": "A piece of Evidence indicates that an Event occured, or metonymically, Entity had formerly existed, in a Location.  The Evidence consists of physical changes to the Location that resulted from the Event.  Some LUs of this frame are general (trace.n) while others specifically involve evidence of motion (trail.n, track.n, wake.n, contrail.n) or existence (vestige.n).  'He was careful to make sure that there was no trace of tampering in the file.' 'The fugitives left tracks in their wake leading the authorities to their hiding spot.' ",

'   ' Scores of illegal immigrants cross the border every year.'   ' Feeding the buffalo is prohibited according to Code 138 . '",
    "Lending": "The Lender gives the Theme to the Borrower with the expectation that the Borrower will return the Theme to the Lender after a Duration of time.  This frame differs from the Borrowing frame in that this frame profiles the Lender in active sentences, whereas the Borrowing frame profiles the Borrower. '' For the time being, this frame includes both the transfer event itself and the end state of the event, as shown in the first two examples following:  'I am lending a student of mine my book on German modal particles.'  'The student has not yet given back the book I lent to him.'  'Not only did I have to borrow a gown, but I was also lent a jacket! CNI'  'I lent my girlfriend my car for the weekend.'  'Jerry loaned his skateboard to his little brother.' ",
    "Level_of_force_exertion": "An Exerter, Action, or Force is capable of exerting or does exert a physical force at a level specified by the target. That physical force may cause deformation or breakage of, or simply motion in the receiving entity. The receiving entity is conceptually present (even if remotely), but is usually not lexically explicit. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses (\"a STRONG person\") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses (\"a STRONG push\"). However, the durative, individual-level meaning appears more frequently in the data and seems more basic.   'Eugenie loved the sea and was a strong swimmer.'  'Spartacus dealt the Roman soldier a mighty blow.'  'A powerful force tore off the tree's branches.'  Exerter, Action, and Force belong to a Core set. ''  There are several productive metaphors covered by this frame. The first and most common is one in which social influence or control is conceptualized as the physical exertion of force. The social influence/control is more specifically a propensity to cause change in social realms such as the economic, political, militaristic, cultural, or intimate: 'There were theoretical limits to the power of the king.' 'Voters in the South have a strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office.'  Another similar metaphor is one in which psychological influence or control is understood as the physical exertion of force. The psychological influence/control includes the emotional as well: 'Poetic words in a text can be given more emotive power by using melisma.' 'He was a forceful speaker.'  A third metaphor involves the amount of an entity construed as the physical force exertion of said entity. Depending on context, amount could be volume, etc. (“STRONGEST critics”; “MIGHTY uproar”).  ''  Two related physical force dynamic frames are Level_of_force_resistance and Dynamism.  This frame is distinguished from the Level_of_force_resistance frame in that it describes the level of force exertion instead of the level of resistance, and also in that there are three categories of Core FE available to the target (i.e Exerter, Action, or Force), whereas in Level_of_force_resistance there are only two Core FEs (i.e. Resisting_entity and Opposing_force). Of the latter frame's FEs, Opposing_force specifies the thing that the main entity resists to a level desginated by the target. Its parallel in Level_of_force_exertion is implied but backgrounded to the extent that it rarely appears as explicit lexical material; thus there is no corresponding Core FE.   This frame differs from Dynamism with regard to individual-level cases; targets here express the FE's capability. In contrast, Dynamism targets express the FE's tendency. For example, \"a STRONG person\" is generally construed as a person who is capable of strength, while \"an ENERGETIC person\" (energetic.a from the Dynamism frame) is construed as a person who tends to be energetic.   However, there is overlap between the two frames in stage-level cases - \"a STRONG push\" and \"an ENERGETIC push\" seem rather comparable. ",
    "Level_of_force_resistance": "A Resisting_entity is capable of resisting or does resist a physical Opposing_force to a level specified by the target. With certain LUs (e.g. impregnable.a), the Opposing_force FE is incorporated, and with many LUs, it is mostly null instantiated. This frame covers both individual-level/static uses (\"the DURABILITY of jade\") as well as stage-level/dynamic uses (\"the shoulder is PLIABLE after stretching\"), although the individual-level meaning is the more basic and is much more prominent in the data.   'The great and impregnable fortress still stands today.'  'His heart is by no means strong, so he should ease into his exercise regime. INI'\t  'They were strapping athletic lads with fine belts and sturdy boots. INI'  'The staircase remained robust under decades of heavy use.'   Productive metaphors include cases where the social resistance of an entity to (an) opposing social force(s) is conceptualized as the physical resistance of an entity to an opposing physical force. More specifically, the ‘resistance’ is an entity’s propensity to resist change in social realms such as the economic, political, and cultural: 'California has had (until now) a robust property market. INI' 'The durability of the peace will soon be tested. INI'  Similarly, there are instances where the entity’s resistance is psychological instead of social, where ‘psychological’ subsumes emotional and other mental properties: 'The idea proved remarkably durable.' 'We should remember the fragility of the human psyche. INI' 'His sturdy resilience to knocks and setbacks was impressive. INI'  ''  Compare to: Level_of_force_exertion. ",
    "Level_of_light": "There is a gradable amount of light in a particular Location.  In some cases the Source of light may be indicated instead of the Location. '' 'The small print was bearly readable by the light of the very dim torch.' '' 'Tal flew over the barrier and into the dark tunnel.' ''  The negetive LUs in this frame can be used metaphorically to describe time periods which can be characterized as bad or lacking in awareness, as shown in the following examples: '' 'The custody of the era brought about a dark period during which the written word was forgotten and art had disappeared.' '' 'Clinton is shrewd to solidify political support during these dark days.'",
    "Light_movement": "An Emitter emits a Beam of light from a Source, along a Path, and/or towards a Goal.  Essentially, this frame denotes the (semi-)fictive motion of the the Beam. 'Avoid allowing light to shine into neighbors' gardens.' 'Clear yellow sunlight shone through the window-panes.' 'She thinks the sun shines out of his backside.' '...when the candles shine out.' 'It shines in my eyes. ('It' is both Beam and Emitter, though only one will show up in the display.) ' '...light shines down on the world.' 'The moonlight shone off the fields.' 'The candlelight glinted from pearls and rubies.'",
    "Likelihood": "This frame is concerned with the likelihood of a Hypothetical_event occurring. The Hypothetical_event is its only core frame element.  'It is likely that he'll arrive late.'  Notice that in the case where a noun phrase is the subject of the Support Verb, that NP is also tagged as Hypothetical_event.  'He is likely to arrive late.' ",
    "Limitation": "An Entity that would be expected to have a characteristic to a certain degree (typically based on comparison to other entities of the same type) instead has a more limited degree of that characteristic.  'The limitations on the theory's applicability made it unpopular in its time.'  'Are there any undocumented limitations on the use of this machine?'",
    "Limiting": "An Agent or Cause limits a Range_of_options to having a certain Characteristic. The Characteristic may be that only certain types of the Range_of_options may be acceptable, or (in the case of a plural or mass Range_of_options) that only certain cardinalities or quanties are acceptable. Alternatively, the Degree to which the Range_of_options is limited may be mentioned.  'His choices in life have limited his opportunities severely.'  'Treatment was limited to one pill per day. CNI'",
    "Linguistic_meaning": "A linguistic Form has a particular Meaning, possibly restricted to a particular Context.  Some linguistic Forms, nouns and nominal expressions, also can refer to an object in the real or an imagined world, a Referent.   '\"Unicorn\" denotes a mythological horse with a horn on its head.'  'In art, the word \"oeuvre\" means \"the collected works of an artist.\"'",
    "Lively_place": "A Location is characterized by a high amount of (often goal-oriented) Activity, or metonymically, with Individuals who are engaged in the activity.  'The park was abuzz with people.'",
    "Living_conditions": "An Experiencer must cope with some Condition for a prolonged period, usually against his or her will.   'Americans live in fear.'",
    "Locale": "This frame contains general locale words, and is mostly a place-holder in the hierarchy. Words in this frame designate relatively stable bounded ares of the world which have permanent Relative_locations with respect to other locales, and thus are useful as permanent landmarks.  It is inherited by Locale_by_use, which has to do with places that are named according to their intended use, or some habitual use, such as factory.n, dance floor.n, village.n, field.n.  It is also inherited by Locale_by_event, which covers places that are names according to some event which took place there, such as concerts, battles, and meteor impacts.  'This is a pleasant area.'",
    "Locale_by_characteristic_entity": "A Locale is characterized by the type of entity associated with the Locale. Some words specifically denote regions characterized by the individuals who typically live or work there. Typcial such Characteristics include ethnicity, national origin, language, and other shared cultural traits.  'This neighborhood started out as a Russian enclave.'  'A twenty-minute walk will take you to the Dutch-speaking quarter of the city.'",
    "Locale_by_collocation": "A Profiled_region is identified as being the region where an Entity is located.  'State your location.'  'I can't get a lock on their position.'",
    "Locale_by_event": "A place defined in terms of an event which occurred (or will occur) there. 'Woodstock, NY was the site of the most important rock concert of 1969.' 'Our meeting site was chosen for its solitude.'  In the second example, the event FE is labeled with two labels, because the two words do not form a syntactic constituent; the first would be GF Genitive PT Possessive, and the second, GF Dependent and PT NP.",
    "Locale_by_ownership": "A place defined by an Owner.  'Get off my property!'",
    "Locale_by_use": "Geography as defined by its use.   'You must land in the next airfield, as this one is currently having difficulties.' 'The new sports complex was the tallest building on campus, oddly enough.' 'Cities of the Northeast tend to be dingier.'",

    "Location_in_time": "The word(s) in this frame detail a particular moment in time.These often occur with demonstratives such as this and that.  'Late that day, 1776, America declared sovereignty.'",
    "Location_of_light": "A perceptible Figure shows up against a Ground location due to Light shining on/from it, its salience possibly dependent on a Cause_of_shine.  'The grass glistened with dew.' 'Still glowing from the forge...' 'The oily mud gleamed wetly under his feet.' 'Something was shimmering on the shore.' 'The quartz glowed with a fitful, internal light.' 'The walls glowed in the sun.'  ''   Note that in this last example, the PP 'in the sun' is both the Ground on the primary FE layer and Light on the secondary layer.   '' This frame is similar to the frame Light_movement; however, in Location_of_light, Light is conceived as stationary, while in Light_movement, light is conceived as traveling linearly outward from a light source, via a path, to whatever objects are illuminated. ''  In both of these light-related frames, there is a very consistent metaphorical conception of emotions as shining in eyes or forth from eyes, including the associated pattern of eyes shining with an emotion.  The sense in such cases is that the eyes (or the muscles and features around the eyes) are in such a configuration as to saliently convey an emotion.  In this metaphor, emotion is conceived as a light-source, with the amount of emotion described as amount of light, temporal patterns of intensity of emotion are patterns of light intensity, properties of the Figure which produce the emotion are described in terms of properties of light-producing objects--thus \"glinting\", associated literally with light on hard, smooth, cold objects like stones, is used to describe the eyes of someone expreriencing a \"hard cold\" emotion like hatred, while \"sparkling\", associated with beauty, is used to describe the eyes of someone experiencing a \"beautiful\" emotion like amusement or excitement.  In both frames, such sentences should be tagged with the metaphor tag to differentiate them from literal sentences like \"His eyes glistened with tears.\"  'Her eyes glinted with hatred.' 'I saw a light in her eyes at the mention of cookies.' ",
    "Location_on_path": "A Figure (fictively or literally) occupies a position within a Profiled_region related to a Ground.",
    "Locative_relation": "A Figure is located relative to a Ground location.    'The cat is on the mat.' 'The kitchen, with its breakfast / snack bar, adjoins on one side while the dining area adjoins on the other side. DNI' 'The president's plane landed in Washington.'  This frame is used for LUs that do not belong in daughter frames, either because they are too general to have any particular image schema associated with them (e.g., here.adv), or because we do not (yet) have a specific frame with the correct image schema (e.g., inland.a).  Prepositions, adverbs, and spatial adjectives that act as targets in this frame and its descendants cooccur with a number of constructions that may supply extra information and should be annotated as extrathematic frame elements.  The location of the Figure may be further specified by its Distance from the Ground along a vector implied by the targets image schema, or the Direction in which the Figure lies from a reference location (generally, the deictic center).  In cases where both seem to cooccur, the Distance actually modifies the Direction, as seen in the following example:  'This pup was lying abandoned, 350 feet down at the bottom of an Arizona canyon.'  There is no sense in which the Distance is measured using the schema for at.prep ('350 feet at the bottom of the canyon' doesn't mean the right thing at all); rather the distance is measured using the schema for down.adv, and is thus considered a modifier of the Direction FE.  In some very specific situations, prepositions, adjectives, and nouns can be used with a copula to describe the whole Profiled_region where a Figure is or could be, as in the following:  'Inside my wallet is where I put it .' 'Outside your blind date's door seems like the worst place in the world .'   ",
    "Locative_scenario": "A Figure is located with respect to a Ground, whose location is (generally) better known. This is accomplished by identifying the Figure as within a Profiled_region--a shape defined by an Image Schema, located at, on, or in the Ground, and scaled by context. Alternatively, a group of Figures is described within a symmetrical Profiled_region located simultaneously with respect to each of the Figures.",
    "Lodging_scenario": "A Host provides a Residence for a Lodger to temporarily stay.",
    "Lose_possession": "Subframe of Transfer in which the Donor begins by possessing a Theme and finishes by not possessing the Theme.",
    "Lose_possession_scenario": "This is the Frame which binds together the initial state of the Donor possessing the Theme, the transfer, and the final state of the Donor not possessing the Theme.",
    "Losing": "This frame describes a situation in which an Owner loses his or her Possession.  The Owner may have failed to keep ownership of their Possession (i.e. robbery or gambling) or may have unintentionally misplaced their Possession. 'I misplaced my watch.' 'He lost his wedding ring while playing cards.'",
    "Losing_it": "An Protagonist goes from a default state of mental and emotional equilibrium into a temporary state of disequilibrium, often a state of anger. A Reason for the change of state may be given. Likewise, Actions that the Experiencer takes as a result of their new emotional state may be expressed. Both Reasons and Actions may be introduced just as coordinated clauses. The lexical units also are frequently accompanied by expressions of an Affected_party.  This frame is populated by many lexical units that are based on the emotion-heat/pressure metaphor.  Note also that many phrases with equivalent meaning to targets of this frame are compositional, e.g. 'go insane', which we treat as the LU insane.a (of the Mental_property frame) plus the inchoative support go.v.  'You totally flipped out on our waiter because of the mix-up with the bill.'",
    "Losing_someone": "This frame describes a Sufferer who experiences the loss of someone through death.  The LUs in this frame imply a strong emotional connection between the Sufferer and the Deceased. 'She lost her husband in the war.'",

    "Losing_track_of_perceiver": "This frames describes a Theme who evades the sight of a Perceiver.  The focus of this frame is the Theme, which appears in subject position.  This frame contrasts with the opposing perspective in Losing_track_of_theme, where the Perceiver is the subject and the Theme is the object. 'The burglar lost the police as the thief turned the corner.'  ",
    "Losing_track_of_theme": "This frames describes a Perceiver who fails to keep sight of a Theme.  The focus of this frame is the Perceiver, which appears in subject position.  This frame contrasts with the opposing perspective in Losing_track_of_perceiver, where the Perceiver is the object and the Theme is the subject. 'The police lost the burglar as the thief turned the corner.'  ",
    "Luck": "A State_of_affairs is evaluated as good (or bad), against a background assumption that previously, the State_of_affairs was thought to be unlikely to occur. The State_of_affairs holds for a particular Protagonist.  'He is a lucky gambler.'",
    "Make_acquaintance": "Individuals first encounter each other and make introductions at a particular Time, Place, or Context. The Individuals may have known of each other before making introductions. The Individuals may  be separately construed as Individual_1 and Individual_2. In some cases, there is a Explanation of the circumstances which lead to the Individuals' meeting.

    "Make_compromise": "Two (or more) people (the Parties, also encodable as Party_1 and Party_2) come to an agreement committing them to carrying out an Obligation. The agreement is construed as non-ideal for both parties but necessary to end a dispute. The process is understood to be symmetrical or reciprocal. Instead of a specific mention of the Obligation, a Topic expression may be used to indicate the domain covered.  'No arms compromise between the two parties is expected before the end of 2012.'  'So you'll compromise with us to continue the project for at least another year?'",
    "Make_noise": "A physical entity, construed as a point-Sound_source, emits a Sound.  This includes animals and people making noise with their vocal tracts. Sometimes the sound itself is referred to with a nominal expression, in which case it is called the Sound. Manner expressions may also be relevant in this frame, if they describe properties of the sound as such.  A path-schema can be overlaid on the simple noise-making scene, adding a Location_of_source and/or a Path.   This frame does not cover scenarios where objects create sound by coming into forceful contact with one another or rubbing against each other. Such scenarios are covered by the Impact and Friction frames. The current frame also does not cover cases where an animate Agent or a natural Force or Cause causes a single Source or several Sources (moving or rubbing against each other) to make noise. Such scenarios are  covered by the Cause_to_make_noise, Cause_impact and Cause_friction frames (the latter of which is not yet existent). Cases where the major emphasis of the portrayed scene is on the motion of a Theme, with sound emission only an accompaniment, are covered by the Motion_noise frame. Likewise, cases where the Sound itself is portrayed as moving through space are not covered in this frame but rather in Sound_movement. Finally, all nouns used to evoke Sounds have been placed in the Sounds frame. We have done this because these nouns do  not denote sound emission/production events but only the Sound itself (*The siren's blare occurred right on time).",
    "Making_arrangements": "An Agent performs a series of unspecified tasks to plan for an Event to take place at a Scheduled_time and Place.  'I've arranged a breakfast meeting for you tomorrow morning with Mr. Huntsberger.'  'Kevin and Beth organized the graduate student conference this year.'",

    "Manipulate_into_doing": "A Manipulator gets his Victim to perform a Resulting_action against what their better judgment would have been at the time. The means by which the Manipulator overcomes or bypasses the Victim's resistance to act need not be linguistic expression.  In some cases, the Goods may stand in for a Resulting_action of the Victim giving the Manipulator the Goods. '' 'Are you trying to tell me that Ace blackmailed you into becoming his lover?'

Only the non-motion uses of these words belong in this frame, e.g., combinations such as push at, push on, yank at. ",
    "Manner": "A Manner describes general or specific characteristics of an event in one of three ways:  First, it can refer to how a Comparison_event transpires, absent the influence of an entity (e.g. \"the way you talk\"). Second, it can refer to how a Salient_entity conducts, performs, or otherwise participates in a Comparison_activity (e.g. \"her manner of speaking\"). Thirdly, the Manner can describe a Foreground_event by relating the Foreground_event to a Manner_descriptor (e.g. \"written (in) a silly way\", \"written the way I do\").  '' 'He completed the task in a fervent manner. ' 'I love the smooth way that you talk.' 'Paul played soccer in a way that reminded me of my brother's playing.' 'Much about a person can be determined from the manner one eats their meals.' ' His way of addressing people is quite rude.'  This frame is unusual in requiring a modifying relative clause for the FE Comparison_event, and also allowing a relative clause to serve as a Manner_descriptor.  The LU way.n, when definite, may be modified by a relative clause meaning \"in the same manner that...\"; the relative clause in such cases is annotated as Comparison_event:  'I did it the way she did.'

    "Measurable_attributes": "An Entity has a particular scalar Attribute with a value exceeding a contextually-specified or generally-understood standard. Except where there is a difference in FEs, we place all adjectives related to measurable quantities in this frame.

'The final total was 606, scored in only 10 hours of excellent batsmanship.'  In this frame, we will NOT annotate deictic, calendric uses of nouns like week, month, etc. as in \"next week, this month, in the 21st century\".",
    "Measure_linear_extent": "This frame is concerned with nouns that denote Units of measurement for linear extent. The Frame Elements are Unit, Count,  and Stuff.'The shirt is made from 12 miles of pure cotton.''81 miles of dyke are still visible from this point.'",
    "Measure_mass": "This frame is concerned with nouns that denote Units of measurement for masses. The Frame Elements are Unit, Count,  and Stuff.'Jelena bought three kilos of apples.''Add a pound of sugar.'",
    "Measure_scenario": "An Entity has a particular Value for an Attribute which may be described in several different ways, including: '' Degree of deviation from the Value expected for the kind of Entity seen in a particular instance, or in comparison to some other explicit comparison set. '' Absolute quantification in terms of the number of Counts of a particular Unit which equal the Value for the Attribute.",
    "Measure_volume": "This frame is concerned with nouns that denote Units of measurement for volumes. The Frame Elements are Unit, Count,  Stuff, and Size. The frame will be split soon into container-derived volumes (box, bottle etc.) and pure volumes (gallon, quart). For the moment we tag things as follows: 'Greg drank two 2 liter bottles of lemonade.' 'Sue drank two liters of beer.' This frame necessitated the introduction of  the GF: Quant and the PT: Num used for expressions such as  the following: 'two cups of coffee' FE: Count, GF: Quant, PT: Num'' Note that we treat cardinal numbers and \"a\" (= 1) in the same way.  'a cup of coffee' FE: Count, GF: Quant, PT: Num'' For the present, we prefer not to annotate \"many cups of coffee\" 'many cups of coffee' FE: Count, GF: Quant, PT: Adj''",
    "Measures": "An Entity is measured in some (implicit) Attribute by quantifying the Count of a particular Unit whose value for the Attribute is known.  LUs and constructions whose meanings inherit from Measures are used in a relatively small, delimitable set of constructions.  They may be complements of particular lexical constructions (a lengthof 20 ft., measures 20 ft.) or parts of non-lexical constructions (including Transparent Noun constructions and Measurement_plus_adjective and Measurement_plus_PP).",
    "Medical_conditions": "Words in this frame name medical conditions or diseases that a patient suffers from, is being treated for, may be cured of, or die of.  The condition or disease may be described in a variety of ways, including the part or area of the body (Body_Part) affected by the condition (e.g. liver cancer, cardiovascular disease), the Cause of the condition (e.g. bacterial meningitis, viral pneumonia), a prominent Symptom of the condition (e.g. asymptomatic stenosis, blue ear disease), the Patient or population (originally) affected by the condition (e.g. bovine tuberculosis, juvenile diabetes), or the (proper) Name used to identify the condition (e.g. Munchausen Syndrome, Lou Gehrig's Disease).  Annotation in this frame is done in respect to the name of the condition or disease.  'John  died of  pancreatic cancer.'",
    "Medical_instruments": "This frame includes words for medical instruments--i.e. Instruments designed for  an institutional function or Purpose.  'Use thestethoscope to check his lungs.'",
    "Medical_interaction_scenario": "A Patient interacts with one or more Medics (doctors, nurses, and/or EMTs with a responsibility for the Patient's health) so that the Medics can determine the health status of the Patient and maintain or restore the Patient's health as necessary.  '' Usually, the Patient has an Affliction, a medical problem that motivates or necessitates their coming into the care of a Medic. At a minimum, the Patient has a single interaction with a Medic, but usually the Patient has a relationship with the Medic or group of medical professionals who either have responsibility for helping them with their specific Affliction or for their health in general. Medical interactions normally take place at a Medical_center (a hospital or doctor's office), but in cases where the Patient suffers a sudden catastrophic Affliction, the Patient may be taken into the care of EMTs, who act as their Medic until reaching a medical center. '' In some cases, the Body_system that has a problem is mentioned in place of the Affliction.  'Her three cardiac patients take up all her time.' 'Our doctors provide the best healthcare on the planet.'",
    "Medical_intervention": "Procedural or Medicine based Interventions are used on a Patient to attempt to alleviate a Medical_condition. These interventions can have a Frequency_of_success as well as Side_effects.  This frame differs from Cure in that this frame deals only with attempts to alleviate a Medical_condition, whereas Cure deals with situations in which the Affliction or Medical_condition has been cured.",
    "Medical_professionals": "This frame includes words that name medical professionals and is closely related to the Medical_specialties frame. The FE Type characterizing a Professional's sub-specialty may also be expressed.  'Ralph is a paediatrician.' 'Paediatric oncologists treat children with leukemia.'",
    "Medical_specialties": "This frame includes words that name medical specialties and is closely related to the Medical_professionals frame.  The FE Type characterizing a sub-are in a Specialty may also be expressed. 'Ralph practices paediatric oncology.'",
    "Medium": "Words in this frame describe a relationship in which an Item is expressed through a Text. 'The act of murder is rampant in the Bible.'  'In his State of the Union Address, President Bush committed our nation to achieving three great goals of our time.'  'Linnaeus in his writings often quotes his great predecessor.'",
    "Meet_specifications": "An Agent or Entity becomes sufficient enough to meet a Standard.  Alternatively, an action or occurrence can be thought of as Event that fulfills a Standard.  In this frame, the Agent, Entity, or Event can be conceptualized as being on a scale where a change of value or circumstances brings it in line with the position of the Standard on the scale. 'This paper does not meet the requirements for graduation.' 'Will Ben fulfill his obligation to Margaret ?' ",
    "Meet_with": "In this frame Party_1 meets with Party_2 at a prearranged Time and Place.  If expressed, Purpose only applies to Party_1.  The Purpose of the meeting is usually discussion over a certain topic. 'I met with my professor to talk about my midterm.'",
    "Meet_with_response": "A Trigger elicits a Response.  The Response may either be some kind of action meant to address the Trigger event or an expressed judgment of the Trigger event. 'Our proposal met with harsh criticism.' ",
    "Member_of_military": "A Person is a member of an organized military organization belonging to a nation-state or similar body. The military membership may be part-time, but is considered a job. This is in opposition to combatants who may be loyal to a particular cause but are not part of the military arm of a government.  'The British at one point had an occupying army of over a million well-trained soldiers.'  'After 9/11 she decided to become a full-time airman'.  'US soldiers have fought in the region for the past twenty years with no end in sight.'",
    "Membership": "A Member is semi-permanently part of a socially constructed Group.   'Victor is part of the Red Crescent'",
    "Memorization": "A Cognizer applies oneself to commit a Pattern to memory, so that the Cognizer would recognize future examples of the Pattern or be able to reproduce it.   'A gaggle of students were frantically memorizing the answers out in the hall.' 'It is possible to memorize by rote and at the same time have a full grasp of the underlying meaning. CNI INI'  This frame differs from Education_teaching in that the Cognizer is construed as acting alone, with no indication of an interacting individual that provides guidance.",
    "Memory": "This frame is concerned with Cognizers remembering and forgetting mental Content.  'John forgot everything about his uncle.'  ",
    "Mental_activity": "In this frame, a Sentient_entity has some activity of the mind operating on a particular Content or about a particular Topic.  The particular activity may be perceptual, emotional, or more generally cognitive.  This non-lexical frame is intended primarily for inheritance.",
    "Mental_property": "The adjectives and nouns in this frame are all based on the idea that mental properties may be attributed to a person (Protagonist) by a (usually implicit) Judge  on the basis of that person's Behavior, as broadly understood.  Though on a conceptual level these words always attribute mental properties to people, they may be applied to Protagonist's Behaviors as well, with the understanding that the Behavior is revealing a (usually temporary) property of the Protagonist responsible for it. For example, while we may speak of a stupid person, we may also speak of a stupid thing to say/do/think. In addition, we may mention both the Protagonist and the Behavior, as in 'It was stupid of me to do that.' Some of the words in this frame also have slightly different uses, in which there is a constituent expressing the Practice with respect to which the mental property holds of the Protagonist, as in:       'She is astute at math.' While Practice expressions do not co-occur with Behavior expressions, they seem sufficiently different semantically to warrant a distinct frame element (FE) name. Also, while the FE Behavior usually occurs in sentences expressing judgments that are based on specific events, Practice occurs in sentences that are about general capabilities. In addition to the frame elements which are expressed, there is an understood judge (usually the speaker) in the background who forms the opinion of the Protagonist's mental properties, judging the Protagonist or the Protagonist's Behavior to be stupid, brilliant, etc.  ",
    "Mental_stimulus_exp_focus": "An Experiencer has an emotion as caused by a Stimulus or concerning a Topic.   'I fall asleep hours later to the sound of their engrossed murmuring.'  'Most of these great lords are downright infatuated with Italy.'",
    "Mental_stimulus_stimulus_focus": "A Stimulus serves to bring about an emotion of mental stimulation in an Experiencer.  'You will not easily find a more absorbing box-set of piano discs.'  'New classes of free radical are particularly interesting to chemists.'",
    "Mention": "A Communicator or Medium briefly references something in a Message, in which only a subpart of the full content is profiled.   'The General Secretary mentions some of them in his report.'  'The Queen 's Speech also mentions the importance of making sure that Iraq complies with United Nations resolutions.'  ' When Barack Obama's name was mentioned, boos filled the room. CNI'",
    "Military": "Some Possessor, either a nation, institution, or private individual, controls a Force whose primary functions to defend the Possessor (or, in the case of an institution or individual, some area of land significant to them) and to carry out offensive actions for the Possessor.  The Domain of operation of the Force may be expressed.",
    "Military_operation": "The Military of a Possessor (either a nation, institution, or private individual) conducts large-scale activities in a Area to accomplish military or combined military/non-military goals.  'These groups are known to have carried out attacks on international coalition forces operating in Afghanistan.'  'Anti-piracy operations will continue while new strategies are developed.'  This frame construes the operation asymmetrically: the Military acts with respect to military and political entities in the target Area. Compare this to (usually, but not always, lower-level and violent) military actions that can be understood symmetrically (war, battle, encounter, engagement, etc).",
    "Mining": "A Miner attempts to obtain a desirable Resource, rocks and minerals, located in a Place being mined, by digging or tunneling in the ground.  'They mine diamonds in Africa.'",
    "Misdeed": "A Wrongdoer engages in a Misdeed.  'You have sinned for the last time, Stephen!'",
    "Money": "Money is a medium used for exchanging goods and services. It is in most cases issued by a government (its Creator) in the form of coins and banknotes. Particular amounts of it may have a designated or planned Use, or may have come from some Origin.  'The money for our daughter's college education is currently earning interest in a savings account.'  'The entire project ended up being funded with Swiss funds.'  'The use of paper money really caught on in Europe in the 1700s'",
    "Morality_evaluation": "In this frame an Evaluee is described by a (usually implicit) Judge with respect to the morality or rightness of his or her Behavior.  'That was very righteous of you to help him.'",
    "Motion": "Some entity (Theme) starts out in one place (Source) and ends up in some other place (Goal), having covered some space between the two (Path). Alternatively, the Area or Directionin which the Theme moves or the Distance of the movement may be mentioned.  'That kite you see just to the right of his head was moving around pretty fast but the camera seemed to catch it ok.'  'There are several accounts of the stench drifting to shore from the ships in the middle of the river'  'Dust particles floating about made him sneeze uncontrollably.'  'The grill, unsecured, rolled a few feet across the yard.'  'The swarm went away to the end of the hall.'  The frames that inherit the general Motion frame add some elaboration to this simple idea.  Inheriting frames can add Goal-profiling (arrive, reach), Source-profiling (leave, depart), or Path-profiling (traverse, cross), or aspects of the manner of motion (run, jog) or assumptions about the shape-properties, etc., of any of the places involved (insert, extract). A particularly complex area in the vocabulary of Motion is the depiction of the relation of Vehicles to the Theme.  In some cases, no separate Theme is expressed:  'The plane flew over the city.'   In this case, the sentence is annotated in Self_motion.  When the Vehicle is profiled as being operated by a Driver, the sentence is annotated in the Operate_vehicles frame:  'Don't try to fly an F-16 without training!'  This is very similar to the Bringing frame which covers cases where the Vehicle is necessarily involved, but the movement of the Theme (something carried by the Vehicle) is profiled:  'It's scary flying hundreds of people over thousands of miles of ocean every day.'  Some of the same vocabulary is also used to describe the situation where Passengers Ride_vehicle or Operate_vehicle (each of these a perspective on Use_vehicles):  'I flew to Chicago on the red-eye.' 'I flew my plane across the Canadian border'   Finally, there are cases where, despite the use of similar vocabulary, there is no self-propelled Vehicle involved at all:  'The ball flew over the fence.'  This last type is annotated in the simple Motion frame.",
    "Motion_directional": "In this frame a Theme moves in a certain Direction which is often determined by gravity or other natural, physical forces. The Theme is not necessarily a self-mover.  ' The paper fell to the floor.'  ' The girl dropped 13 stories to her death.'",
    "Motion_noise": "This frame pertains to noise verbs used to characterize motion.  Motion_noise verbs take largely the same Source, Path and Goal expressions as other types of Motion verbs.  'The reception doors banged open.' 'Guillemots and razor bills whirred rapidly out to sea.' 'The limousine purred forwards into the traffic.' 'Loose guns rumbled all over the ship's deck .' 'The train clanged along for over a thousand miles.'",
    "Motion_scenario": "This frame binds together the various parts of movement, from setting out, to traveling, to arriving.",
    "Moving_in_place": "A Theme moves with respect to a Fixed_location, generally with a certain Periodicity, without undergoing unbounded translational motion or significant alteration of configuration/shape.  'It vibrated from the wind.'",
    "Name_conferral": "This  frame contains words that talk about how Speakers name Entities.  'They drove through an area nicknamed Sniper's Alley' 'His parents named him Winston after the British prime minister.'   In this frame we will ignore uses of words like baptize and christen that don't clearly bring out the name conferral but talk about the meaning of baptism etc. as a sacrament:  'They christened  the child on December 4th.' 'Method was baptized into the church soon thereafter.' 'Cyril was baptized as  a Methodist.'  ",
    "Namesake": "An Entity shares a name with its Namesake. Note that the shared name is not a frame element as it cannot be directly expressed as an argument of the target lexical units in this frame.    'Alberta's namesake caught in royal scandal' ' namesake caught in royal scandal' 'Instead, the eponymous character is a mildly retarded woman, Martha (Winger), whose simplistic view on life places her in ethically compromising positions. DNI' 'He is my namesake, one amongst the many described in my homepage, and is much better qualified to write a page like this.'",
    "Natural_features": "The Locale is a geographical location as defined by shape.  This frame includes natural geographic features, including land/ice forms and bodies of water.  ' We climbed up the rock cliff.' ",
    "Needing": "The speaker believes that some state of affairs or entity (the Requirement) must be present in order to cause some other dependent state of affairs to occur (the Dependent).  In the typical case, the Cognizer desires the occurrence of the Dependent and so also desires the obtainment or occurrence of the Requirement.  'I need one more bolt. DNI' 'I need one more nail to finish building the cabinet.' 'In order to complete the treaty, the United States will require several more diplomats.' 'He needs everyone to leave his office to finish his work.'",
    "Negation": "This frame models the semantic contribution of negation, in which the profiled content of the Negated_proposition is asserted to contrast incompatibly with a corresponding Factual_situation, which is normally implicit.  The Negated_proposition and the Factual_situation share non-focal content, on the basis of which they correspond, and contrast in a subset of their content, the focal content, established with reference to a set of focus constructions not described here.  (The focus of negation is often conveyed intonationally in spoken English; in text, however, negative focus must be derived inferentially from contextual reference. A subset of focus constructions will be annotated in the constructicon.)  '' While the semantics of negation are quite different from the semantics belonging to most frames, at a minimum, our modeling of the concept using frame semantic tools can be viewed as a practical attempt to label a problem and annotate examples that may inform further research. '' Negation can be evoked verbally (analytic or synthetic) or nominally. Negators include \"not\", \"no\", \"never\", and negational affixes, such as those used on inflected verbs in synthetic verbal negation (wasn't, isn't, haven't).  'It 's not far from here . INI' 'She 's not smart , she 's sly .'    ",
    "Negative_conditional": "An Anti_consequence is presented as not occurring if the Profiled_possibility occurs.  'Unless we try harder , we 're gonna lose an opportunity here .'",
    "Network": "A set of entities of the same or similar types (Nodes) are linked to each other by Connections to form a Network allowing for the flow of information, resources, etc.  'For the most part, the Interstate System is a connected network of highways bounded by the Canadian and Mexican borders, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic.'  'Through our worldwide network of representatives and agents, Lozenger Inc.  was able to serve customers in countries around the globe.'",
    "Noise_makers": "The Noise_maker is an artifact used to produce sound, especially for musical effect.  'The church bells rang' 'The car alarm went off again' 'I have never played an acoustic  guitar.' 'Each artist personally owns a Steinway and has chosen to perform on the Steinway piano professionally'",
    "Non-commutative_process": "LUs in this frame describe a non-commutative process (as opposed to a generic statement) of arithmetic, e.g. subtraction and division, involving two numbers, labeled Term_1 and Term_2.  Because of the non-commutative nature of these processes, Term_1 and Term_2 are not separated on a grammatical basis but rather on a mathematical basis (see FE definitions). When referencing the process, the numbers can be vague and are often omitted through indefinite null instantiation.  'I divided x by y.'",
    "Non-commutative_statement": "LUs in this frame describe a non-commutative statement of arithmetic, e.g. subtraction and division, involving two numbers, labeled Term_1 and Term_2.  This frame contrasts with Arithmetic_non-commutative_process in that the statement frame emphasizes the relationship between the terms in combining to form some Result.  ''Because of the non-commutative nature of these processes, Term_1 and Term_2 are not separated on a grammatical basis but rather on a mathematical basis (see FE definitions). When referencing the process, the numbers can be vague and are often omitted through indefinite null instantiation.",
    "Non-gradable_proximity": "A Figure is characterized as near the Ground, according to some contextually given scale. Many lexical units of this frame additionally specify in which direction relative to the Ground one can find the Figure (under.prep, north.adv), or directions from the Ground from which the Figure is excluded (e.g. beside.prep excludes the vertical and front/back axes); for specifications of direction, see the semantic types attached to the lexcial units.  Members of this frame that make reference to an absolute, earth-based grid (e.g. north, south, etc.) imply a geographic scale of proximity, and so are frequently not paraphrasable as \"near\".   'She put her shoes under the table .' 'Michael Jackson was right next to me !' 'Down by his left foot was a little grenade .' '' The subset of LUs that inherently pick out a particular direction (e.g. north, behind) may occur with a specification of a Distance in that direction from a Ground at which the Figure may be found, while LUs that pick out two or more directions of relevance from a Ground (e.g. beside) can only characterize the general accessibility of the Figure relative to the Ground. '30 miles north' 'right beside my leg'  This frame is intended to cover a limited set of productive metaphor cases in which allegiance is expressed as a Devotee standing to one side or behind an Allegiance_holder:  'I stand beside what I said to him .' 'They will stand right next to me in the fight against homophobia .'  This frame is not intended for metaphorical cases of quantity specification:  'There was above 500 kg of cocaine in the shipment .'  This frame does not cover the multitude of other metaphorical cases like \"next to impossible\", \"under consideration\", \"under his rule\", \"beside himself\", \"beside the point\". ",
    "Noncombatant": "This frame contains words that denote people who are not participating in a military Conflict.  'Jones was a noncombatant in WWII.'  'News comes in every day of civilians getting caught up in military operations.'",
    "Notability": "An entity is considered worthy of mention for their ability or influence among some Type of similar entities. The entity need not be well-known or famous, though if it is, it may be stated by its Name only. Their worth may be restricted to a Time or Place.  'Dali is one of the great artists of the 20th century.'",
    "Notification_of_charges": "The judge or other court officer (the Authority) informs the Accused of the Charges against him/her, i.e. the alleged actions and the relevant laws. '' 'The board has been accused by the federal court of making decisions based on narrow agendas and meddling where it shouldn't.'  'The police charged a young nurse with four murders.' Compare to: Citing. ",
    "Nuclear_process": "An Initial_element is converted into a Final_element via a process of decay, fusion, or fission which changes the number or type of hadrons (protons or neutrons) in the nucleus of the atoms that make up the Element.  '5.5 percent of nucleii decay from tritium to He3 in a year .'",
    "Objective_influence": "An Influencing_entity, an Influencing_situation, or an Influencing_variable has an influence on a Dependent_entity, Dependent_situation,  or a Dependent_variable.  ''  Compare to Subjective_influence. Words in Objective_influence are used to make claims about correlations in the world, where words in Subjective_influence are used to explain emotional impacts made on cognizers.   'More and more doctors realise that diet can influence disease.'  'Our subject is the body clock; how it influences our physiology and behaviour and how it interacts with the rhythms in our environment.'  'But it is more likely that a physical restraint influenced the swirling liquids.'  'It claimed, perhaps hollowly, that NT had yet to impact its business.'  'This kind of elementary boo-boo would certainly impact video speed.'",
    "Obligation_scenario": "Under some, usually implicit, Condition a Duty needs to be fulfilled by a Responsible_party. If the Duty is not performed, there may be some undesirable social Consequence for the Responsible_party. This Consequence may or may not be stated overtly. ",
    "Obscurity": "An Entity is obscure, unnotable, and in general little-known. In the case of an eventive Entity, lack of fame entails a large number of people not being aware of the event's occurence; in the case of a concrete Entity, including humans, lack of fame entails non-awareness of existence.  'Geoffrey Rush was little known outside his native Australia when he soared to international prominence.'",
    "Obviousness": "A Phenomenon is portrayed with respect to the Degree of likelihood that it will  be perceived and known, given the (usually implicit) Evidence, Perceiver, and the Circumstances in which it is considered.  For several of the LUs, such as visible, audible, etc., the type of the Evidence is fixed by the targets themselves being a perceptual experience.  'It's abundantly obvious that we'll need to spend more time on public perception.' 'Are you certain that the shovel was visible from the door of the apartment?' ' I think they miss some of the important impacts of the work that are not visible just from looking at the vote tally.' 'That the defense will declare a mistrial regardless is quite evident from their consistent obstructionist tactics.' 'In late July 2000 it was barely visible to the unaided eye.'",
    "Occupy_rank": "This frame is about Items in the state of occupying a certain Rank within a hierarchy.  'He ranks second in his class in mathematics.'",
    "Offenses": "Words in this frame describe acts in violation of a legal code.  'He was accused of hijacking a tour bus full of people.'",
    "Offering": "An Offerer indicates that he or she is able and willing to give a Theme to a Potential_recipient. In the absence of further qualifications, it is often understood that the Potential_recipient accepts the Theme.  'The host graciously offered us food and drink.'",
    "Offshoot": "This frame refers to a part of an organization that becomes separate from the main body. The part is usually partially or even wholly autonomous, and may eventually become larger than the body from which it originated.   'Methodism is an an offshoot of the Church of England' ",
    "Omen": "One phenomenon, the Predictive_phenomenon is an indication of the future or current (but still uncertain) existence of another phenomenon, the Future_phenomenon. There is no Cognizer present on the scene, in distinction to the Expectation frame where a Cognizer takes (the equivalent of) Predictive_phenomenon as evidence for (the equivalent of) Future_phenomenon. Many words in this frame also allow a slightly different understanding, whereby Predictive_phenomenon provides clues as to the good or bad Outcome of an expected Future_phenomenon. Instead of Future_phenomenon an Interested_party that will be involved in the Future_phenomenon may be mentioned. In both construals, the two phenomena are asymmetrical and consequently they have no joint syntactic realization.  '  Such potential augurs  well  for the 1990s ' 'Its appearance was an  ill omen. ' 'Cold-blooded words do not necessarily betoken a callous nature.' 'I wish I could say my success  bodes well for him.'      ",
    "Ontogeny": "An Entity develops from a Prior_state to a Post_state.  The Entity can also be represented by an entity-denoting adjective which is labeled Domain as shown in the first example below.   NOTE: This frame is not intended for the evolution of an entire species, but rather the development of a single organism.  '' 'Yesterday we learned about neural development.' '' 'Sherman studies nervous system development in toddlers.' '' 'The researchers were studying the development of hair cells. ' '' 'This small bud will grow into a flower someday soon.'",
    "Openness": "A Useful_location is accessible to some (possibly generic) Theme despite a potential Barrier, or is not accessible because of the Barrier.  'I left the door to the lobby open for you.' 'I left the door to the lobby open for you.'",
    "Operate_vehicle": "The words in this frame describe motion involving a Vehicle and someone who controls it, the Driver. Some words normally allow the Vehicle to be expressed as a separate constituent. 'Tim drove his car all the way across North America.' 'Tom paddled my canoe across the Canadian border.'  Other words in this domain are based on the names of vehicles, and do not normally allow the Vehicle to be expressed as a separate constituent. 'The group biked all the way across the country.'  However, a separate Vehicle constituent can occur if it adds information not included in the verb. 'Tim biked across the country on an old 10-speed.'",
    "Operate_vehicle_scenario": "This frame describes an Operator interacting with a Vehicle to transport him/herself (and possibly others) from a Source to a Goal. The three primary stages are preparation for canonical operation, operation of the vehicle proper, and bringing the vehicle back to a state of rest, where it may continue to move but not in its typical fashion.",
    "Operating_a_system": "An Operator manipulates the substructure of a System such that the System performs the function it was created for.  This frame differs from the Using frame in that this frame does not profile the purpose of an agent but rather their manipulation of an entity (System/Instrument). In the case of using, the Agent need not manipulate the Instrument at all, as in: Mrs. Adams used the room as a place to hang the family laundry to dry.   'This true story of domestic bliss was related to me by a friend of mine who for a time operated a bar in San Francisco.'  'A California man has plead guilty to federal charges that he ran a pyramid scam which defrauded nearly 7000 investors.' ",
    "Operational_testing": "A Tester uses a concrete or conceptual Product in order to determine either whether it works or to find out how well or in which manner it works. The Tester may have particular Unwanted_characteristics in mind that they are specifically looking for. The operational test may also be carried out under a particular set of Circumstances that are typically relevant to the functioning of the Product.  'Sun has (hopefully) already tested it for compliance.' 'The Velcro hook and loop closure system has been tested under wet conditions and retains its holding power after 10,000 open and close functions. CNI INI' 'Roe revisited the compound and tested it as a mosquito repellent.'",
    "Opinion": "A Cognizer holds a particular Opinion, which may be portrayed as being about a particular Topic.  'John thinks that it looks better back .' 'Well, my opinion about that is none of your business. '  'What 's your take on the recent oil crisis ?'  'Your view of Smithers as an excellent secretary is not shared by the rest of the UN.'",
    "Opportunity": "An Agent has a choice of whether or not to participate in some Desirable_event because of an Opportunity, a situation not completely under the Agent's control and usually of a limited duration.  'It would be pleasant in the opportune absence of the clergyman to have a dance . DNI'  'Her opportunities to apply to a good school are then limited .'  'Now was their big chance ! DNI'",
    "Optical_image": "This frame describes non-artifact Images resulting from an interation between light and some kind of matter, usually a Source entity.  'I could see John's silhouette in the corner as I entered the dimly lit room.'",
    "Ordinal_numbers": "An Item is picked out either by the order in which the members of a set would be encountered by an implicit cognizer, or by the order in which the members of a set participate in an event or state which serves as the Basis_of_order. The former case usually involves a Starting_point for going through the set, while the latter involves a Basis_of_order, which is normally an event that the Item along with other members of its Comparison_set has participated in.  Note that Item should be annotated on a second layer, except in cases when the noun structure the ordinal participates in is predicative.  'The first car from the left is a Magosix.' 'The first car from the left is a Magosix.' 'Barney was only the second Asian student at my college.' 'Felix was the first of my cats to realize that human food was tastier.' 'Felix was the first of my cats to realize that human food was tastier.'",
    "Organization": "This frame describes intentionally formed human social groups (here termed Organizations) with some definite structure and Members.  They may be relatively informal, consisting only of a group of individuals who are aware of who is and who is not a fellow member, or they may be complex and long-lasting, such as the Roman Catholic Church or the Conservative Party.   'Lucien is in the brotherhood.'",
    "Origin": "An Entity began its existence in the context of a Origin, which can be a place,  culture, time period, text, etc.  'The Christian origin of this quote is from Isaiah 22.'  'Dinosaurs originated from Antarctica?'  ''",

DNI '",
    "Part_edge": "This describes a part_whole relationship where the Part provides the boundary between the Whole and what is not that object.  The Part can exist along a continuum of width.  It can be modified by an Orientation that specifies the particular portion of the edge of a Part_prop which describes a property of the Part.   'We came to the southern edge  of the town  . '",
    "Part_inner_outer": "This frame concerns Parts of objects that are defined relative to the center or edge of the object.  The Part is a part of the Whole and the Part_prop describes a property of the Part.  'She discarded the exterior of the walnut.' ' She preferred a sparse church interior . '  In cases where the Target is an adjective, it has a special relationship with the noun that it modifies such that a phrase which is a syntactic argument of the noun is semantically available to fill the argument structure of the adjective, as in \"the outside row of the class\"'The inner shelf of the bookcase was lying on the floor.'  ",
    "Part_ordered_segments": "In this frame a Part is part of a larger Whole comprised of parts that are ordered. The Parts can be ordered temporally (first to last and vice versa) or vertically (down to up and vice versa).  The Part can be modified by the Part_prop or the number of the part can be given by Ordinality. '' ' I sat through the first interminable act  of the play  . ' ' Tess finished a  dissertation chapter . ' 'The first level of rock consisted of sediment from the Neolithic period.' 'The last layer of sediment was also the thickest.'",
    "Part_orientational": "In this frame, there is a Part of a Whole in which the Part is defined with respect to the canonical or inherent orientation of the Whole. In cases where the Target is an adjective, it has a special relationship with the noun that it modifies such that a phrase which is a syntactic argument of the noun is semantically available to fill the argument structure of the adjective, as in   'the front  row of the class '  'The top  shelf of the bookcase was lying on the floor.'  'The bottom was missing.'  'My left  hand was numb.'  'He rested on the clifftop'   ",
    "Part_piece": "This frame is concerned with transparent nouns denoting a Piece of a Substance. Also present is Piece_prop which is a property of the Piece, e.g. relating to its size.  'Kim ate a tiny morsel of cake '.  ",
    "Part_whole": "This frame is concerned with nouns denoting a part or parts of a Whole entity . The Part is not defined relative to the Whole's orientation, center, or edge and is not ordered.

The Domain in which the Judge is partial or impartial may be expressed as well as the Degree of bias or lack thereof.  In sentences in this frame one may also find expressions of Manifestation_of_bias, i.e. expressions that tell us how the Judge's bias is realized.  'The judge made a biased decision.'",
    "Participation": "An Event with multiple Participants takes place. It can be presented either symmetrically with Participants or asymmetrically, giving Participant_1 greater prominence over Participant_2. If the Event is engaged in intentionally, then there is typically a shared Purpose between the Participants. It is, however, possible that an expressed Purpose only applies to Participant_1.   'MATAC looks forward to your participation in helping promote telework in the Mid-Atlantic region.'  ' FOAP provides participants with comprehensive clerical skills. DNI' ' FOAP provides participants with comprehensive clerical skills. '   'Our eight-year-old son was recently  peripherally involved in an incident which resulted in him being threatened with the strap.'

    "Partitive": "A Subset is profiled against the Group it belongs to. The Subset may consist of a single member. Frequently, the Group is actually a generic sample of a full population, and the Subset is  representative of the relative proportion.  'Of all scenes that evoke rural England, this is one of the loveliest.'  ' As of 5:30 p.m. Moscow time, 23 out of 46 miners stranded in the Zapadnaya-Kapitalnaya mine have been rescued'  '1.5 out of  10 respondents preferred Shrub over Ferry'  ",
    "Passing": "An Agent physically transfers a Theme to a Recipient. The Agent is not under control of the Theme's motion after the initial input of energy.   Compare with Bringing and Sending. In the former, the Carrier is in constant control (even physical contact) with the Theme. In the latter, the Sender plans the motion of the Theme and places it in circumstances such that it travels along the specified path (or to the specified goal), but under the power of a separate individual.  'Pat passed me the ball.'",
    "Passing_off": "An Agent acts in such a way as to cause others to think that an Item is an instance of a particular kind of Simulated_entity.  'He had, under the name of Armitage, passed her off as a member of one of the most distinguished families of the capital.'  'He undoubtedly believes you are the impostor who palmed himself off at Bar Harbor as the Baron von Kissel.'  'Knowing his likeness to the family of Lord Polperro she palmed him off on them as a distant relative.'",
    "Path_shape": "The words in this frame describe the \"fictive\" motion of a stationary Road.  Some of the targets cast the scene primarily in terms of the Path_shape:  'The long mountain road meandered through the woods.'  Some of the words in this frame imply a Source or Goal which is expressed by a direct object:  'The path entered the garden on the west side.'  Other members of the frame refer to a Direction: 'Then the path bears a little to the right.'  Yet others indicate a Path which requires mention of a landmark:  'The otherwise arrow-straight highway veers north and skirts the lake.'",
    "Path_traveled": "A Path, a series of connected locations, is traversed by a Theme, moving under its own power or under the influence of a physical force. The Path may be described in various terms depending on whether it is bounded or not. If it is bounded, the Path may be identified by its Endpoints, which may be presented separately as Source and Goal.  'For Earth, these perturbations slowly change the eccentricity of the planet's orbit around the Sun.'  'From the eyewitness accounts, as well as satellite data, videos and photos, Brown and his team have worked out the meteor's path through space.'  'Its period around Saturn is just under one Earth day, meaning that it really barrels along, to cover its 700,000 mile orbit in such a short time.'",
    "Patrolling": "An individual or group, the Patrol moves through and examines a Ground in order to ensure that it is in a generally Desired_state_of_affairs, particularly that it is safe and contains no dangerous Unwanted_entity. Rather than moving through the Ground, the Patrol may simply move such that all the (relevant portions of) Ground can be observed and checked.  'Detective Jones patrolled the northern half of the building.'  'Security guards patrolled for intruders while the game was in progress.'",
    "Pattern": "This frame describes the interrelation of a collection of Entities; they may be physical entities or shapes in a recognizable configuration, a pattern of events, or a relation among abstract entities.  The pattern is not the individual Entities nor the set of Entities, but an abstraction of their interrelations, as a gestalt.  'The Cougers are playing in a Wing-T formation tonight.' 'The auditors noticed a suspicious pattern of withdrawals from the maintenance account .' 'The digits of irrational numbers do not repeat in any kind of pattern' ",
    "People": "This frame contains general words for Individuals, i.e. humans.

    "People_along_political_spectrum": "An Individual belongs to a  group that is categorized in terms of the political views on particular issues that the members of the group  tend to share, in opposition to other groups that hold different beliefs on the issues. The views on particular issues that the Individual shares with the other members are assumed to result from general principles or beliefs rather than being accidental or temporary.  'Leftists vow huge protests during inauguration'",
    "People_by_age": "This frame contains words for individuals as viewed in terms of their age. The Person is conceived of as independent of other specific individuals with whom they have relationships and independent of their participation in any particular activity.

    "People_by_origin": "This frame contains  words for individuals, i.e. humans, with respect to their Origin. The Origin is generally incorporated, but may occasionally be specified separately.  The Person is conceived of as independent of other specific individuals with whom they have relationships and independent of their participation in any particular activity. They may have an Age, Descriptor, Persistent_characteristic, or Ethnicity.   'I'm a proud Brit.'",

    "People_by_residence": "This frame contains  words for individuals, i.e. humans, with respect to their  proximity of residence. This relationship may be defined either symmetrically (as Residents) or asymmetrically (in terms of a Known_resident and a Indicated_resident).  The Residents or the Indicated_resident may have an Age, Descriptor, Persistent_characteristic, or Ethnicity specified.    'The dead included homeowner Todd Underfoot, 33, his wife Spring Back Underfoot, 32, their housemate, Luisa Life, 46, and two of the Underfoot's three children.

    "Perception": "A Perceiver perceives a Phenomenon. The general Perception frame is an inherited background to all frames that have to do with some sentient being responding to changes in the environment, independently of the sensory modalities.  The inheriting frames may specify the modalities (see, hear, taste, smell), or may emphasize the experiences or acts of the perceiver (peek, eavesdrop), or the properties of the perceived phenomena (clank, rattle, thump).",
    "Perception_active": "This frame contains perception words whose perceivers intentionally direct their attention to some entity or phenomenon in order to have a perceptual experience.  For this reason we call the perceiver role in this frame Perceiver_agentive.    'She gazed upon him fondly.'  Comparing the Perception_active frame to the Perception_experience frame, we note that for some modalities there are different lexical items in each frame.  For instance, whereas Perception_active contains the verb phrase look at, Perception_experience contains see.   For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical item in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell.  This first sentence exemplifies the Perception_active use of the verb smell:'Smell this to see if it's fresh.CNI' This second sentence exemplifies its Perception_experience sense: 'I smell something rotten.'  ",
    "Perception_body": "This frame contains words describing physical experiences that can affect virtually any part of the body. The body part affected is almost always mentioned with these words. It is typically expressed by the noun heading the external argument, and this noun is typically accompanied by a possessive determiner that refers to the possessor of the body part, as in the first example below:  '' 'My head hurts!'  'Nuadu, aching in every bone, had not made a sound.'",
    "Perception_experience": "This frame contains perception words whose Perceivers have perceptual experiences that they do not necessarily intend to. For this reason we call the Perceiver role Perceiver_passive. Comparing the Perception_experience frame to the Perception_active frame, we note that for some modalities there are different lexical items in each frame.  For instance, whereas Perception_experience has see, Perception_active has look at. For other sense modalities, we find the same lexical items in both frames.  To illustrate, consider the verb smell where I smell something rotten exemplifies its Perception_experience use and Smell this to see if it's fresh exemplifies its Perception_active sense. This frame also includes words which are not specific to any sense modality, including detect, perceive, perception, sense.  '' 'Abashed, realising that he had overheard her conversation with Victoria, Sheeley didn't try to make excuses.'  'She smelled the wine on Paul's breath, and bade him to sit down.'",

The Person is conceived of as independent of other specific individuals with whom they have relationships. They may have a Descriptor, Origin, Persistent_characteristic, or Ethnicity. A specific Age may sometimes be specified as well.  'Smithers is an actor.'",
    "Performers_and_roles": "A Performer has a certain Role in a Performance and plays their part by following the directions in the Script for that particular Role.   'Margaret Thatcher played Juliet in a school play.' '\"Pulp Fiction\" starred John Travolta and a lot of other big names.' 'Mel Gibson starred in \"Braveheart\" as the leader of a Scottish rebellion.' 'I play the character of Yusuf in this film.'",
    "Performing_arts": "The Performers, together with behind the scenes Personnel, execute a Performance according to a Script and/or Score.  The purpose of the Performance is to create an experience for an Audience, who then judge its merits.  Performances may be in many different Mediums and be of various Types.   This frame is very elaborate in modern society and there are a number of traditions and practices typically (but not necessarily) related to Performances:       The Performance is preceded by many practice sessions in which the Performers and other Personnel attempt to improve the quality and/or fidelity of their individual and collective performances to the Script and/or Score.         The Audience members pay a fee to experience the Performance.       The Performers (and Personnel) receive payment for contributing to the Performance.       Often there are other individuals involved in the specifically financial aspects of the Performance and Performers.       Critics act as part of the Audience and then write reviews that evaluate the merits of the Performance, describing the Performance to other potential Audience members.       Due to the high quality of previous Performances, Performers can become famous, i.e. well known and liked.  Those who like them particularly well become fans of the Performer.  (Shared with writers...)",
    "Personal_relationship": "The words in this frame have to do with people and the personal Relationships they are or can be a part of.  Some of the words denote people engaged in a particular kind of Relationship, others denote the Relationship, yet others the events bringing about or ending the Relationships. Many of the words presuppose an understanding of states and events that must have occurred before another event takes place or before a person can be classified in a certain way. '' 'And of course that drippy boyfriend of hers backed her up.'  'As the happy couple took their places there was a stir and a rising babble behind them.'  'Pattie is living proof that if you live with a man, you discover a lot you didn't know when you were just dating him.'",
    "Personal_success": "A Person is in a state of prosperity and/or renown after some period of development or hardship in an Endeavor.  LUs in this frame invoke a developmental path that is related to the goal one should have in a Person, such that the Person, after traversing a path of development (including hardship, effort, and time), completes or does not complete these goals. Note that this distinguishes an event's success in this frame from Successful_action.  'Framenet is enjoying huge success.' 'He had a long and successful career in banking.'",
    "Physical_artworks": "A physical object, the Artifact, is produced by a Creator to stimulate the perceptions, emotions, or cognition of an audience. Though it need not, in many cases, the created Artifact is intended to represent an actual or imagined entity or event, the Represented. The Represented may be specifically shown in a particular state (State_of_represented).    'Sir Denis Mahon is the owner of the most important private collection of Italian Baroque paintings.'  'He presented Eddie with a watercolour painting and a bouquet of flowers to his wife Frances'  'I just took a picture of the screen and plan to share it with 6.4 billion of my closest friends on the Internet tonight.'",

    "Placing": "Generally without overall (translational) motion,  an Agent places a Theme at a location, the Goal, which is profiled.  In this frame, the Theme is under the control of the Agent/Cause at the time of its arrival at the Goal.  'David placed his briefcase on the floor.'  This frame differs from Filling in that it focuses on the Theme rather than the effect on the Goal entity.  It differs from Removing in focusing on the Goal rather than the Source of motion for the Theme.",
    "Placing_scenario": "This frame represents the abstract scene in which an Agent manipulates a Theme's location, thus affecting a Goal which ends up co-located with the Theme.  This frame is primarily for Inheritance.",
    "Planned_trajectory": "A Theme traverses a trajectory. This trajectory consists of a Source, Path, and Goal. If the Theme is sentient, the anticipated trajectory will usually be equivalent to the planned trajectory. If the the Theme is non-sentient the anticipated trajectory will usually be the result of various forces acting upon the Theme.  '' 'The dog went that waytowards the ice cream factory.'",
    "Planting": "This frame describes a situation in which the Agent puts the Theme into the Ground for the purpose of growing. 'He recently planted some old apple trees. INI '",

    "Point_of_dispute": "The answer to a Question is under discussion in a Group, which still  has a difference of opinion among its members. The prominence of the Question relative to others can be indicated by a Status expression.   'Firstly, it is quite clear the issue in this context was not so much apostasy as much as it was treason.'  'The question in Finucane's case is this: will an inquiry bring out the truth?'  'It remains an issue of central importance to women .'  'Democracy in Serbia was blocked by the unresolved national question.'",
    "Political_actions": "A less-powerful person or group of people (the Activists) engages in an activity aimed to inconvenience or weaken a more powerful person or group (the Institution) to seek redress, in the form of a series of Demands, for the wrondgoings committed by the Instituion.

    "Political_locales": "This frame covers words that name Locations as defined politically, or administratively.  'Berkeley is a wonderful city.'",
    "Popularity": "An Evaluee, which can be a person or an object, has an amount of acceptability or utilization based on general (often non-aesthetic) desirability. The Judge who determines the Evaluee's desirability may be mentioned.  'Frank Sinatra is cool again.' 'Web 2.0 is so in right now.'",
    "Posing_as": "An Agent behaves as if they were a particular individual or type of Simulated_entity with the intent of misleading observers of their behavior.  This is generally accomplished by altering their normal appearance (especially dress), mannerisms, voice, and other observable characteristics.  'The belfast bank robbers posed as police.'  'These groups are masquerading as mainstream groups, yet after taking a closer look you see they are the most extreme.'",
    "Position_on_a_scale": "This frame contains words that describe an Item's static position on a scale with respect to some property Variable.  '' 'Dried fruits are especially high in fibre, as are pulses.'  'Despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver, by 1865 most of the mining traffic through Las Vegas was of propectors headed to California or Northern Nevada in search of gold.'",

    "Possibility": "A Possible_event is deemed to have all pre-conditions satisfied; in other words, it has some probability of occurrence, if some (generally implicit) further Condition pertains.  The Condition, whether overt or implicit, often concerns the decision of an agent to attempt to bring the Possible_event about. The primary implication is that certain other aspects of the situation that might have been expected to prevent the Possible_event, usually lack of capability or permission, do not pertain.  'You ca n't burn glass . INI' 'You can have two more if you want .' 'This sense of lack can never be satisfied .' 'We just ca n't stand it anymore . INI'  This frame is confusable with the Capability frame, which specifically involves an Agent who is presented as needing only the decision to perform an Action in order to successfully perform the Action.",

    "Practice": "An Agent enacts an Action that is intended to be performed again at one or more later Occasions.  The goal of practicing is to ensure that the action at the later Occasion(s) comes off flawlessly.   'I practiced my song for the play.'",

    "Predicting": "A Speaker states or makes known a future Eventuality on the basis of some Evidence. Instead of (or in addition to) a Speaker, a Medium may also be mentioned. Likewise, a more general Topic may be stated instead of an Eventuality.  ' The Weather Centre predicted  that it would be warmer but wet for the weekend.' 'Another seer who forecast a Tory majority -- without compromising his impartiality -- was Sir Robin Day .' 'Based on current calculations, the European market is  forecast to grow 18.1% by the end of next fiscal year.' 'The website claimed to prophesy what the world would be like in the near-future.'",
    "Preference": "An Experiencer has a greater desire to participate in some Event, as against another (contextually recoverable) event which exhibits a specific Contrast with the Event. Alternatively, the Experiencer may have a greater desire that some Focal_participant participate in the Event. The Location_of_event may also be mentioned.  'Why do women prefer manly faces?'

    "Preliminaries": "This frame describes means actions (Preparatory_acts) that are taken by an Agent for the purpose of preparing for a later act.  Contrast this frame with a scenario involving earlier versions of some entity being superseded by later versions (e.g., preliminary results, advance copy).  'This update lays the groundwork for future improvements.'",
    "Presence": "An Entity exists at a particular Location, at a particular Time, as observed by an implicit observer. A Depictive and/or Duration phrase is often found.  This frame differs from Existence in that the Location is profiled as a ground where an observer is conceived of as confirming the Entity's existence.  'Liquid water was present on the surface of Mars billions of years ago.'  'Urate was present in varying concentrations in the bathing solution only.'  'No one was present. DNI'  'Your presence is appreciated. DNI'  In some cases, the Location may be recoverable from phrases that primarily express peripheral information:  'Was the senator present for the committee vote?' 'Was the senator present for the committee vote?'",
    "Presentation_of_mitigation": "A  Mitigating_situation is presented as occurring against the backdrop of a more preferable situation and a less preferable situation that, while expected, feared, or hoped for, did not or will not occur; the Mitigating_situation is thus, so to speak, sandwiched between a better and a worse situation, both of which are relevant in the discourse. Understanding the Mitigating_situation is therefore dependent on understanding the better and the worse situations, one or the other or both of which normally have already been mentioned or strongly evoked in the discourse. The relation of the Mitigating_situation to these situations may be filled in by discourse-level inference, as in the first example below, or implied by contrastive intonation, as in the second example.   'At least I don’t have to go to school.'  'Ava, anyway, knew who he was.'  When the Mitigating_situation clause involves a negation, like in the first example above, the non-negated form is generally taken to be the worse situation - potentially also in combination with previous discourse context. (i.e. Perhaps there's been a blizzard.  The better situation is that a blizzard did not occur.  The mitigating situation is that a blizzard occurred, but I don't have to go to school.  The worse situation would be that a blizzard occurred, and I also have to go to school.) '' Targets in this frame frequently occur in constructions that obscure the full 'Mitigating_situation:'  'There will be no exceptions -- not for you, at any rate.' In this example, there is a fragment ellipsis construction that depends on the semantics of the immediately preceding context. '' Lexical Units of this frame also frequently occur with the use of or that conveys a speaker self-correction or hedge. The function of this sort of or is to introduce contradictory possibilities without endorsing any of them.  In combination with targets of the Presentation_of_mitigation frame, or joins a clause that represents the better situation to a second clause (or fragment) marked with an LU of this frame, with the overall intent of saying that even the less preferable alternative is still suitable to carry forward the point that the speaker wishes to express: 'She traveled, and now she is back here to transform our drab little lives, or at any rate, our drab furniture.' '' The humorous point in this example is that, even if their drab lives are not transformed (the better situation), at least their drab furniture will be, while the worse situation is that everything simply remains drab.  Note that this example, and most examples involving or, occur with the Shared_completion construction, meaning that two parts of the sentence have to be annotated: the shared part of the first clause and a fragment directly marked with a Presentation_of_mitigation LU. '' This frame is to be distinguished from two related frames, Concessive and Conditional_scenario. In Concessive and its daughter frames, either a Main_assertion or a Conceded_state_of_affairs FE (or both) are present, and both FEs, even though seemingly contradictory, are simulateously true. Here, however, only the Mitigating_situation actually occurs. Targets in this frame may be embedded in larger Concessive constructions, such as the below with although, where the better situation is made explicit (in negated form): 'Although she’s not my favorite, a new actress has won this time in any case.'   In Conditional_scenario, a Profiled_possibility and its Consequence, as well as an Opposite_possibility and its Anti_consequence, can be presented. Neither of the possibilities is asserted as true, nor is a desirability scale with better and worse ends evoked.   'If it rains, the ceremony will be under the tent.' 'Unless you read carefully, you won't understand what I said.'  ",
    "Preserving": "In this frame an  Agent preserves a Patient in order to prevent it from decaying.   A Medium may be used.   'Bill mummified John.'  'Tess pickled the beets  in vinegar.'  'The Smiths dried the apples.'",
    "Prevarication": "A Speaker communicates about a Topic in such a way as to mislead an Addressee, either by telling outright lies or by presenting a message in a misleading form.  'I lied to you about your Christmas present.'",
    "Prevent_or_allow_possession": "An Agent or Potential_hindrance keeps a Protagonist from having a State_of_affairs that they need or desire, or, despite the possibility of preventing the possession, they allow the Protagonist to have the State_of_affairs.  'His parents deprived him of food for days on end.'  'Our lonely city starves us of original live music.'  'Employees were denied overtime pay and meal breaks. CNI '  'Allow me just one more cupcake ! CNI'",
    "Preventing_or_letting": "A Potential_hindrance or an Agent (via their actions) keeps an Event from taking place, or despite the possibility of prevent the Event, do not do so. Lexical units which indicate that the event is not prevented, e.g. allow.v, are marked with the semantic type \"Negative\".  Some lexical units, like avert and avoid indicate that the Potential_hindrance or Agent would have been affected if the Event occurred.   ' Rain prevented the ball game from taking place.'   ' He could have stopped the riot .'  ' The government narrowly averted a coup . ' 'She allowed more than a few mistakes to happen .' 'Technology has permitted firms to link together more closely.' 'Unlike DOS , Windows lets you get on with something else when sending a fax.' 'Liberalization allows easier entry into particular markets .' 'Mesh allows the water to circulate normally through the aquarium.'  ''  Unlike in the Thwarting frame, the Potential_hindrance or Agent does not directly prevent the actions of an individual, but rather affects the world in such a way that an Event cannot occur.",
    "Price_per_unit": "A Product is offered by a Seller at a particular Price such that some total cost for the Buyer in the transaction is a multiple of the Price.  'Additional telephone rates may apply.'",
    "Prison": "This Frame deals with Penal_institutions. They are run by an Operator and may be intended to hold certain kinds of Inmates.  Penal_institutions may have a special Name and their Location may also be indicated.  'He's in Pelican Bay state penitentiary.'",
    "Probability": "This frame characterizes the likelihood that a Hypothetical_event will happen as a position on a scale of impossible to inevitable. The likelihood can expressed as numerical Odds or a metaphorical representation of the Position on a scale.  'There's a 20 % chance that you'll succeed.' 'The odds that he'll actually do it are one in a million.'",
    "Process": "This frame describes a complex event which lasts some amount of time, consisting of a beginning stage, a stage where the process is ongoing, and a finish or end.  In some cases the process may pause, and then possibly resume.  In this frame and its subframes, the distinguished argument is a Process, and there is no reference to an Entity which undergoes this Process or an Agent which initiates this Process.    In formal terms, this frame refers to an overall controller x-schema (Narayanan 1997) with subframes corresponding to parts of the x-schema.  'I'm in the process of writing it down.'",
    "Process_completed_state": "A Process is finished and can no longer proceed.  'The project is complete.'",
    "Process_continue": "An Event continues at a certain Place through Time.  (Note that often when 'continue.v' occurs with definite time points, it denotes Resumption, which is out of frame here.) NB:  Refer to Process frame. '' 'Pyongyang agreed to suspend its withdrawal while talks continued with Washington.'  'Missions and different plans proceed according to Islamic law provision.'",
    "Process_end": "A Process comes to an end.  'The project came to a close.'",
    "Process_initial_state": "The initial State of an Entity in an event; part of the Event X-schema. NB:  Refer to Event frame.",
    "Process_pause": "The Process stops making progress towards completion, but should resume and continue.",
    "Process_resume": "An event resumes at a certain Place and Time.  NB:  Refer to Event frame.  '' 'Both matches will resume tomorrow, after a day of rest.'  'Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian authority have resumed.'",
    "Process_start": "An Event begins at a certain Time and Place. Reason may also be indicated.  NB:  Refer to Event frame.  'The project began.'",
    "Process_stop": "A Process stops at a certain Time and Place.  Reason may also be specified.  A Duration may be included in order to indicate the length of the persistence of the Paused-state before action resumes.  NB:  Refer to Process frame. '' 'The strident, static-like hiss ceased abruptly.'  'The use of railway-owned vehicles on aggregates traffic ceased altogether in 1989.'",
    "Process_stopped_state": "The State of an Entity after an Event has stopped, i.e. part of an X-schema. NB:  Refer to Event frame.",
    "Process_uncompleted_state": "A Process is in a state where it can no longer be completed.",
    "Processing_materials": "An Agent alters some Material in some useful way by means of some chemical or physical Alterant.  Typically, this involves placing a reagent in contact with the Material, or applying heat, pressure, etc.  Often a specific Agent and/or Result is mentioned. The Alterant is often incorporated in the target, as in tin.v, galvanize.  (The Preserving frame is a special case of Processing_materials, in which the Material is immersed in the Alterant for the Purpose of preventing decay.)  Processing_materials is distinguished from Filling in that the Material in Processing_materials is fundamentally altered (often chemically), rather than simply being covered with a different substance. 'Native Americans dyed textiles with dyes made from cedar strips.' 'Watering cans are often galvanized to prevent rust.' ",
    "Procreative_sex": "This frame exists to define a type of Sex where the intended result is procreation.",
    "Product_delivery": "In order to facilitate the purchase of Goods which start off in a location distant from a Purchaser, a Deliverer transports and hands off the Goods to a Purchaser or (more indirectly) a Goal location which is accessible to the Purchaser.  ",
    "Product_development": "An Developer develops a Product, in some cases for a Company.    '' 'The development of a profitable product will be necessary for the company to stay afloat. INI' '' 'Heinrich will develop a great new product for Apple someday. '",
    "Product_development_scenario": "An Developer works to create progress on an Entity.  The Entity typically goes through three stages of development: the conceptual process (Achieving_first); the development process (Product_development); and the manufactuing process (Manufacturing).  The Entity can also undergo additional processes such as designing, engineering, prototyping, and testing.  ",
    "Product_line": "A specified Designer or a Brand creates and distributes a Collection of related Products. The individual Products may all be part of a set or may just be related by season or other arbitrary reason.  'The new Gucci line is due out in early Spring.'  'He gave her the entire Oscar de la Renta springcollection for her birthday.'  'Clorox now produces a line of eco-friendly cleaning products.'  'Her new product line turned out to be a wild success.'",
    "Progression": "An Entity changes from a Prior_state to a Post_state in a sequence that follows a pre-defined plan, expectation, or model of change.  The change is usually assumed to be an improvement for the Entity. Because this frame is describing change according to some known model of the Entity, the Prior_state and Post_state are backgrounded, and often implicit.  'Their offensive armament has developed from short range missiles to long-range ballistic weaponry in a relatively short period .' 'The maturation of warhead technology is, perhaps, not far off .' 'Recovery in our major overseas markets has progressed tentatively and increased spending by consumers and government does not appear to be benefiting this' 'Why have we developed economically as we have?'  This frame is not equivalent to the frame Improvement_or_decline for two reasons.  Firstly, Progression implies a smooth or multi-stage change involving several different states of the Entity in an expected sequence, while Improvement_or_decline may be simple or complex, in accord with an expected sequence or not.  Secondly, progression along an expected sequence does not necessarily mean that things get better (or worse) for the Entity.  This is clear in the case of progression of a disease, since different ailments have very different expected sequenes, with initial onset leading to expected disappearance (for cases like the cold), or to permanent impairment (in the case of Parkinsons), or to death (in many forms of cancer).  However, it is more confusing in the very common case of the progress of a biological Entity from birth to death, where this frame often emphasizes the phases of the lifespan where the organism increases in ability, thus reaching a more desirable state.  Plans are also spoken of as progressions, and because the expected sequence is towards the goal of the agents that formed the plan, these uses of the progress frame also emphasize improvement. ",
    "Prohibiting_or_licensing": "In this frame a State_of_affairs is prohibited (or allowed) by a Principle. Raising constructions are common in this frame. Because laws and principles usually focus on what is not allowed, the words of this frame that are synonyms of prohibit.v are considered more basic, and the words that are synonyms of permit.v are marked with the semantic type \"Negative\".  ' Guns were prohibited in the airport .'  ' Code 1425 bans large trucks in the tunnel.' ' Children were not permitted in the office. CNI'  ' Code 1425 allows us to deduct interest payments.' 'No religion accepts discrimination against women.'  In this frame the Principle which prohibits the State_of_affairs is not an agent who denies permission to a specific individual or group of individuals, and thus differs from the Authority in the Deny_permission frame. ",
    "Project": "An Agent, which may be an individual or group, is engaged in a complex Activity.  A larger Goal which motivates the Agent carrying out the Activity may be indicated. Instead of a particular  Activity, a Field of endeavor may be indicated. The project may also have a Name and the Time when as well as the Place where it is ongoing may be specified.  'The New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) is dedicated to helping the public buy a safer car.'  'The school will continue with its project to end all violence related to racism, xenophobia and intolerance.'",
    "Proliferating_in_number": "The number of entities that make up the Set changes from an Initial_number to a Final_number. Alternatively, the situation can be described in terms of an Initial_state and a Final_state. In some cases the Attribute (i.e., number) or Difference in number may be mentioned.   ' How has the proliferation of cellular telephones affected your amateur mobile operation? INI INI'  'The number of rural poor has dwindled from some 250 million to 26 million.'  'Problems in the banking industry proliferated dramatically in the 1980s.'",
    "Prominence": "An Entity stands out perceptually in comparison to other members of its type.  'Pilot Mountain in NC is very prominent.'  'First, from the Saturday images, the most prominent feature is a sharp spike emerging from the tailward side of the nucleus.'  'I was left with a deep and conspicuous scar (about 10cm long) which felt uncomfortably tight and itchy.'  ",
    "Proper_reference": "A speaker marks explicitly that he intends to describe an Entity in a more restricted sense than it was used in the immediately preceding discourse, and that therefore his Intended_referent is different from the one that the hearer might have picked out based on the way the Entity label was previously used.  'Of these, nowadays there are 308 within the city proper, and 534 if suburbs are included.' 'Of these, nowadays there are 308 within the city PROPER, and 534 if suburbs are included.'  'The writing in the WSJ is always excellent, with the majority of its writing staff located in New York proper.' 'The writing in the WSJ is always excellent, with the majority of its writing staff located in New York PROPER.'  'Israel Radio said Israel would turn over the town itself, while agreeing to resume discussions over the surrounding villages in two weeks.' 'Israel Radio said Israel would turn over the town ITSELF, while agreeing to resume discussions over the surrounding villages in two weeks.'",
    "Proportion": "Criteria exist that identify a particular Subset of a Group of things into members and non-members. In this frame, a comparative relationship is determined which indicates the size of the Subset relative to the larger Group, expressed as the Ratio.  ' Urban areas have> a higher teen suicide rate than rural areas. '",
    "Proportional_quantity": "The Denoted_quantity is (generally) an imprecise characterization of the quantity of Individuals or a Mass, made with reference to a relatively easily and precisely imaginable Reference_quantity.  'It took about three hours, but we 're done now.' 'But there were barely 300 in the whole district. DNI' 'Put in right around a pinch and a half. DNI ' 'She waited a good second before knocking.' 'She waited a good second before knocking.'",
    "Protecting": "Some Protection prevents a Danger from harming an Asset.  'The rubber on her sneakers protected her from the mud.'  'The coral reefs shielded the coastline from the worst of the waves.'  'A growing number of sustainable farmers are preserving agricultural variety and protecting biodiversity by raising ?heritage? or ?heirloom? varieties.'  'The man responsible for this entire ordeal cowardly shielded himself from justice with the little boy's struggling body.'",
    "Protest": "A Protester (or Protesters) expresses a strong opinion either in support of or against an Issue, or the Action(s) of a Side which relate to the Issue. The public expression of support or opposition often involves multiple Protesters participating in an orginized assembly in a public area.  'Several hundred Tibetans, already worried by inflation, took to the streets to protest at the new measures.'  'Fourteen people were killed in the demonstration for the unemployed.'",
    "Provide_lodging": "A Host provides a temporary Residence for a Lodger.  'We housed her in our home for a while.'",
    "Proximity_image_schema": "A Profiled_region is picked out which is near to (or far from) the Ground to a certain Degree.  The Profiled_region cannot contact or overlap the location of the Ground, as this is categorically different--see Contact_image_schema and Collocation_image_schema.",
    "Public_services": "This frame concerns permanent organizations (the Institutions) that are intended to help members of the Target_group in a particular Domain with a Service_action.  Most or all relevant members of the Target_group have a direct relationship with the Institution.  'The Red Cross Tracing and Message Service is a service for finding and reuniting families separated by war and disaster.'  'First and foremost, Radio-Canada is a public service. '  'The California Child Protective Service investigated the family based on a complaint filed by the son's former principal.'",
    "Publishing": "A Publisher makes a Work of an Author (or authors) available to some public Audience for general enjoyment, examination, and reference. The Medium of a Work can vary; examples include books, TV programs, movies, and radio shows. Publication normally involves a number of other events, such as editing and advertising of the Work, and mass production and sales of a represenation of the Work; thus in the most elaborated version of publication, there are a number of other potential roles, such as editor, publicist/advertizer, distributor, printer, etc., but none of these show up as separate, syntactically distinguished roles for the LUs in this frame.  'Doubleday is publishing my newest novel next week.' 'I 'm publishing my next one with Random House .'",
    "Punctual_perception": "A Perceiver briefly perceives a Phenomenon, often resulting in partial or uncertain perception.  A Body_part that enables the perception may be mentioned, either metonymically replacing the Perceiver or in addition to the Perceiver.  'I 've been waiting here to catch a glimpse of the snow leopard for seven hours.' 'If you go in there, you 'll get an eyeful. INI'",
    "Purpose": "An Agent wants to achieve a Goal,  or an object.  A Means  has been created or is used to allow the creator or a user to achieve a  Goal. The Goal is a state of the world that does not currently hold but which the Agent wants to realize and is planning and/or working towards. In some cases, it is difficult to decide whether a noun phrase metonymically stands for the Agent or the Means (e.g. The goal [of this paper/seminar/project] is to determine ...). We mark these phrases as Agent on the first layer but also annotate them as Means on a second annotation layer.  In some cases a Restrictor on the Goal state of affairs can be given prominence as a separate constituent. Talking about Goals frequently includes the mention of a Domain to which the Agent's Goal is relevant.  'The modest American goal of a threefold increase in capacity recognises this fact .' 'The object of the tutorial is to help a student concentrate on his writing skills ' ' The prime goal of the programme was to help develop processes of scientific thinking in children .' 'My goal in this book is to introduce the reader to Web programming applications.' 'The president's economic goal for the country was to overcome the recession.'",
    "Putting_out_fire": "An Agent causes a Fire to no longer burn.  ",
    "Quantified_mass": "This frame contains transparent nouns (and some adjectives) denoting quantities of a Mass or of Individuals. As opposed to aggregate words such as group, set, these Quantity do not have a status as Wholes on their own.   'He found them in the deluge of papers on his desk.'  Initially, at least, we have annotated both Quantity of Masses and of Individuals in this frame, though we may split the frame along these lines later on. ",
    "Quantity": "This frame contains nouns denoting Quantities of a specified Entity and their numerical Values.  Note that the nouns in this frame DO NOT convey a gradable amount on thier own. 'His heart attack was caused by a high cholesterol level.' 'His cholesterol level was 124 mg/dL.'",
    "Quarreling": "A group of Arguers (also expressible as Arguer1 and Arguer2) express incompatible opinions or beliefs about an Issue.  'We bickered about semantics for an hour.'",
    "Questioning": "The words in this frame have to do with a Speaker asking an Addressee a question which calls for a reply (as opposed to making a request which calls for an action on the part of the Addressee).  '' 'We asked Ruby what kind of food they ate.'  'Yeats was able to interrogate the spirit world about his relationship with Maude.'",
    "Quitting": "An Employee voluntarily leaves the service of an Employer.  'Leah quit her job after one month because of an evil force.'  ' It's Time for Glenn Hubbard to Quit as CEA Chair' 'Its chief executive officer has resigned amid a reorganization that will also eliminate about 20 percent of its work force.' 'Its chief executive officer has resigned amid a reorganization that will also eliminate about 20 percent of its work force.' 'You should fill in your name, the defendant's name, and the date and time you gave notice. DNI'  ",
    "Quitting_a_place": "A Self_mover leaves an initial Source location.  The Path by which the Self_mover departs, and the Intended_goal of the Direction may also be mentioned.  In many words which evoke this frame, there is an additional implication that the Self_mover is discontented with the Source location.  'I left San Francisco for Vancouver.'",
    "Race_descriptor": "This frame covers LUs that describe the race of a Person.  'Carlos is hispanic, or so he says.'",
    "Range": "There is a certain physical Distance within which some other entity can participate in an Event (typically perception or manipulation) with the Participant.  Alternatively, the Event may be indicated metonymically by a Instrument .  [Note the connection with *Distance, Sufficiency, and Capability.  Words in this frame can generally be paraphrased \"close enough to be able to\".]  'I'm sorry, but he was well within the blast range.' 'They are now within our missile range.' 'They are now within our missile 's range.' 'They are now within missile range.' 'But then they passed out of my earshot. INC' 'I would consider striking distance to be about two meters for this weapon.' 'Jordanian troops came within easy strike of Israel.'",
    "Rank": "This frame contains nouns denoting a rank or level within an established hierarchy.  'His rank is colonel.'",
    "Ranked_expectation": "An Entity is rated as unexpected for its context in terms of its magnitude.  Either some different type of Entity with a different scope would be expected, or a different amount of the Entity.    'The entire apple was riddled with worms .' 'The inevitable fate of the Warsaw Resistance fighters was not finally sealed until nine whole weeks of vicious fighting had taken a terrible toll on the people .'  'A mere two percent of Afghan women are registered to vote.' 'The crime scene doesn't wrap up in an hour, never mind an entire investigation . ' 'It 's a huge engineering project when you 're building a whole car .' Although there are some words that overlap between this frame and Completeness, the words in this frame indicate specifically that the magnitude of the Entity is different from what is expected, rather than grading an entity as to whether all its parts are present.  The Ranked_expectation uses must occur with an explicit or implicit quantification.  The Completeness uses can only occur with entities that have salient necessary parts and structure.",
    "Rape": "The words in this frame describe situations in which the Perpetrator has sexual intercourse with the Victim forcibly (or by threatening the use of force) and without his or her consent. '' 'Does the press make it more difficult for raped women to obtain justice?'  'On their third date he took her back to his surgery and raped her.'",
    "Rashness": "A Protagonist performs some Action without fully considering the circumstances under which he or she acts, or the possibly (negative) consequences of the Action.  Alternatively, the Action itself may be portrayed as having been performed under rushed circumstances.  'Would it be a little impatient of me to ask when an album might appear?' 'He was quick to move, alert and forceful, as he was impetuous in attacking an enemy'",
    "Rate_description": "The LUs in this frame describe the level that a Rate, or the variation in some quantity over a period of time, deviates from the norm. The focal Event for which the Rate is relevant may be profiled as metonymically referring to the Rate of the Event. This frame differs from Rate_quantification in that it does not describe the Rate with a specific numerical designation.  'The rapid increase in obesity is a major cause of concern.' 'Such systems have a very rapid rate of recovery.'",
    "Rate_quantification": "An Event occurs that can be characterized by a given Rate. The Rate is a ratio of how much a particular quantity changes over time. Degree compares the the given Rate with a standard or expected rate for a similar Event. The Agent is a participant in the event who is responsible for the Rate. '' 'We compared the evolutionary rates of the two different species of monkey.' 'Graduation rates have not gone up in the last decade.'",
    "Ratification": "A Ratifier responds to a Proposal constructed by another party to make it binding over the Ratifier's jurisdiction or constituency.  'The ratification of the Kyoto protocol has been a long, hard slog.' 'The US is considering ratifying the cybercrime treaty. ' 'The Malaysian government will ratify the UN's anti-smoking programme by the end of the year. '",
    "Reading_activity": "A Reader visually examines a Text, typically in a linear order, to understand its content.  In place of the Text, a Topic may be mentioned.  'She ca n't read . INI' 'They read the bible nightly .' 'I 've read about you !'  '' This frame differs from the Reading_perception frame, which obligatorily focuses on the perceptual and cognitive interpretive aspects of reading; unlike Reading_activity, targets in Reading_perception require explicit mention of the Text being examined.  While Reading_activity is broad enough to cover the same circumstances as Reading_perception, it also covers situations where reading is contrasted merely with another task or leisure activity, when reading is considered generically, and when the Topic unifying the reading activity replaces mention of a Text. '' Additionally, this frame differs from Hearsay in that Reading_activity is focused on what the Reader is agentively doing, whereas in Hearsay, the focus is on what the Hearer knows and how they know it.  As a result, most valences are unambiguous: full clause complements for the Message point to the Hearsay frame, while Text or lack of any complement indicates the Reading_activity frame.  The only overlap is in the case of Topic, where the frames can be still distinguished by factivity of the Topic.  In other words, read.v used in the Hearsay frame, just like hear.v in the Hearsay frame, when used with a Topic, indicates clearly that there is some specific fact related to the Topic that the reader or hearer now knows and understands. Thus the first and second of the following sentences belong to Hearsay, the last to Reading_activity: 'Yes, I read about how you won teacher of the year .' 'I just read about the accident .' '' 'I was reading about dinosaurs all day.'   ",
    "Reading_aloud": "A Speaker interprets a written Text and speaks the contents, usually to an Addressee. The contents may be the Text verbatim or a representation of the text.   'I do think they read to them when they are little. INI'  'Inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of the pig-iron. DNI'",
    "Reading_perception": "The Reader attends to a Text to process its information.  Sometimes a particular kind of Sought_phenomenon is sought in the Text. '' The metaphor which allows motion verbs plus \"through\" to express reading (e.g. \"went through the text\", \"slogging through the phonebook\", \"sped through the dialogue passages\") is considered to be productive, and thus should be annotated in the Motion frames.  The metaphor applies most productively to motion verbs that do not specify motor program and either specify no manner information at all (e.g. \"go\") or only specify the manner of motion in terms of difficulty and/or speed (\"slog\", \"speed\"), although other verbs with specific information (\"saunter\", \"swim\") may occur in more colorful usage.  'I read A Tale of Two Cities last night.' ",
    "Reason": "A volitional  Agent is responding to a State_of_affairs by performing some Action.  'And was that your reason for becoming an actor ?' 'But Giles is the reason that I am here .' 'Oh my reason for including it was Section fifty four A.'  ",
    "Reasoning": "An Arguer presents a Content, along with Support, to an Addressee.  The Content may refer elliptically to a course of action or it may refer to a proposition that the Addressee is to believe.  Some lexical units (e.g. \"prove\") indicate the speaker's belief about the Content.'Jan argued that the evidence was inadmissable.''Jan argued against the admissability of the evidence.''Jan proved  that the evidence was inadmissable.'",
    "Reassuring": "A Speaker conveys a Message to an Experiencer in order to reassure them about a Situation; Medium and the Means of the communication also may be expressed.   'We reassured him that his decision was sound.'",
    "Rebellion": "An individual or group, the Rebel, rejects the authority of the Current_leadership, and attempts to bring them out of power. The rebellion may, but need not be violent. Rather than expressing rebellion against the Current_leadership, the lexical units in this frame may appear with expressions describing the Current_order, the system of rule which the Rebels reject.  'In 1641 there was a Catholic rebellion against the Protestants of Ulster, and English authority over the island was shaken.'  'How do they justify their armed insurgency?'",
    "Receive_visitor_scenario": "A (potential) Visitor arrives at a location associated with a (potential) Host. The Host permits the Visitor to enter the location, and allows the Visitor to avail him/herself of available resources, in order to pursue some goal. The visit is often for social or entertainment reasons. After a temporary stay at the Host's location, the Visitor departs.",
    "Receiving": "A Recipient comes into possession of the Theme as a result of the joint action of the Donor and the Recipient.  The Receiving frame like the Giving frame requires that the Donor first has possession of the Theme and that following the transfer, the Donorno longer has the Theme and the Recipient does.  'I recieved a box from him in the mail.'",
    "Receiving_scenario": "The sequence beginning with the Recipient not having the Theme and ending with the Recipient in possession of the Theme. ",
    "Reciprocality": "This frame characterizes states-of-affairs with Protagonists in relations with each other that may be viewed symmetrically.  When the Protagonists are equally prominent, each equally serving to identify the others, they are expressed together as Protagonists.  When one of the Protagonists serves to define the other (more or less as a Ground), it is called Protagonist_2, and the other is called Protagonist_1 (i.e. the Figure). '' This frame exists as a background for a number of lexical frames, including Chatting, Similarity, Exchange, and Being_attached.  The most basic frames inheriting from this one are symmetrical states.  (For example, Being_attached is symmetrical, since if A is attached to B, B is attached to A.)   '' Other frames exhibiting reciprocality either have a causative/inchoative relation to such a stative frame (e.g. Becoming_attached), or are stative-like summarizations of multiple events of the same kind.  This second type, in which events are performed reciprocally, with two equal participants acting on each other, can be exemplified by the Chatting frame in which two people are effectively both speakers and addressees in a joint act of communication.  '' The basic characteristic of this frame, inherited in the daughters, is the equivalence of Protagonist_1 + Protagonist_2 to Protagonists, and the further equivalence (modulo figure/ground profiling) of the following: '' Protagonist_1 Relation with Protagonist_2. '' Protagonist_2 Relation with Protagonist_1. '' Protagonists Relation.",
    "Recording": "An Agent sets down in permanent form information about the occurrence of a Phenomenon. Alternatively, the Agent records that an Entity had a particular Value for one of its Attributes.  'While visiting in Port Alberni, the day before he was diagnosed, we recorded him to have 14 drinks and go to the bathroom 10 times.'  'William Hickey's death is not recorded. CNI'  'The voter turnout was recorded as over 90 percent. CNI' '...... voter'  'A number of US expressions of alarm presented during those weeks to the Israeli government were registered in the premier's diary. CNI'",
    "Records": "A Record that contains a permanent account of Data.  This Record may be maintained by a Recorder for a certain Entity.   '' 'The bank's books were not accurate.'  'He made notes of the subject's responses in the journal by the desk.'  'She kept a record of how many times Steven had asked her for money.'",
    "Recovery": "These words describe the recovery or healing of a Patient from an Affliction without reference to the influence of any Treatment or Healer (see the Cure frame).  '' 'My injuries had not yet completely healed.'  'Henley MP Michael Heseltine, recovering from a heart attack got a very public get well card.'",
    "Redirecting": "An intentional Agent or a causing event (Cause) event causes a Theme which is already in motion to take a different Path or Direction, or reach a different Goal than the Original_path.  'The hotel business didn't last - especially after the construction of a railroad diverted travelers a few miles west to what is now the village of Eagle'  'Pakistan government officials helped and diverted the trucks to another camp in the no-man's land in Mach.'  'Prior to the arrival of the president's motorcade, the police redirected the protesters away from the main roadonce more.'  ",
    "Reference_text": "In a text, a Source_of_information is given that provides a reader of the text with further Information relevant to the text. In this frame the author and reader are completely deprofiled, with the Source_of_information made salient.  'In Densmore's days it was sometimes made of an old-fashioned man's celluloid collar (cf. Densmore 1943: 116).'  'The 'foaming regions' play the role of 'internal shocks' (cf. Piran's recent publication for a review) of GRB theory.'  'Use my() for local variables whenever you can get away with it (but see perlform for where you can't).'",
    "Referring_by_name": "A Speaker uses a particular linguistic form, a Name to refer to an Entity.   The Entity often is an interlocutor but may be somebody that the Speaker is talking about, or even just a physical object. Note that we include titles such as \"Sir\" in the Name category.   'They corresponded frequently and at length, exchanging intimate letters in which he addressed her as Windflower. '  'We always called her \"my lady,\" from the moment that she was put at the head of our section;'  'Sharpton called him Obama Baracka in HIS speech .... of all the people to screw his name up!

' Advanced Micro Devices is going to call its next chip the Athlon 4' ",
    "Reforming_a_system": "Because it no longer functions adequately under the given circumstances, an Agent (or non-Agentive Cause) undertakes steps to change the structural makeup of a complex Entity with interdependent parts, for instance an institution or a system of laws. The Degree of change is typically gradual and partial rather than revolutionary and total. Note that with some LUs the Entity can be unexpressed when it is identical to the Agent.  'They want to reform the law on Sunday trading.' 'At the same time , the government reformed the rating system as it applied to companies.'  'This study investigates how and why the majority of large Slovak companies restructured without the help of foreign investors or a government. DNI'",
    "Regard": "A Cognizer has a Judgment of an Evaluee, expressing how high or low their regard for the Evaluee is.  'What do you think of him as a linguist?' 'She secretly thought well of him for his role in defrocking Mr. Matthews.' 'Please understand, I hold you in the highest regard.' 'My low opinion of him was of long standing.'",
    "Region_with_portal": "A Portal, Exterior, Surface, Boundary, and Interior are picked out relative to a Ground. ",
    "Rejuvenation": "The action of an Agent or the occurrence of a Cause event returns an Entity to an earlier  state of vigor and strength.  'Falling prices and wireless connectivity have breathed new life into the PDA market. '   'While Paul Reubens resuscitates his career, Pee-wee fans use the Web to keep the 'adventure' alive.'   'Athens' democracy was unexpectedly reinvigorated by its great defeat.'",
    "Relating_concepts": "A Concept_1 is related to Concept_2 by some Evidence.   'The single remaining piece of evidence linked Kirov the tailor to Kirov the dissident activist.'  'There is ample data relating earnings to years of schooling.'",
    "Relation": "A relation holds between Entity_1 and Entity_2.  'I see no relation between these animals.'",
    "Relation_between_individuals": "Two sentient beings have a permanent or semi-permanent Relation to each other.  This relation may be symmetrically construed as between the Individuals or it may be construed assymetrically, such that Individual_1 is identified by their relation to the (implicitly better-known) Individual_2.",
    "Relational_location": "This is a general frame that identifies a Profiled_region whose configuration is specified by an image schema (specified in more specific child frames) and located relative to a Ground.",
    "Relational_natural_features": "The Focal_feature is defined in relation to a Landmark_feature, either as a particular part, or as an immediately bordering entity.  'I'm on the summit of Mt. Shasta.'",
    "Relational_political_locales": "A Locale is defined politically to be the head of state of another, larger political locale, the Container_possessor.  'She had repeatedly been to the capital of the nation, and there had met with a reception none too cordial.'  'He decided to stay in the capital of Iraq for two months while he recuperated to fight another day.'  'The largest city in the area, Oakland is the county seat of Alameda county.'",
    "Relational_quantity": "A quantity, the Numerator, can be understood in terms of how it relates to another quantity, the Denominator; the comparison of these two numbers is called the Rate. The nouns in this frame may denote the Rate unless the referent is specifically expressed. This frame is a general description of the relationship between any two dependent quantities; children of this frame may describe situations in which the scale of the Numerator and/or the Denominator is fixed.  'I'm not paying the high interest rates.'  'The nest egg is going to be taxed at a federal rate of about 55 percent.'  'This assumption is commonly adopted in statistical models that are used to estimate the transmission rate of HIV.'",
    "Relative_time": "These words relate to the relative ordering of two events or times.  There are two major types of relations evoked by the words of this frame.   '' Some of the words (e.g. follow.v, antecedent.a, previous.a) describe the (definitively) stative relationship between two events (the Landmark_occasion and the Focal_occasion).  This first type will be moved to the Time_vector frame.  'After she arrived , she laid out her papers on the desk.' 'The following morning, she tried to figure out what it meant . DNI'  '' Others (e.g. belated.a, early.a) refer to the change or deviation of an event from the Landmark_occasion (which is expected or usual at a particular time) to the Focal_occasion (which occurs at a different time).  Quite often, a Focal_participant who is saliently involved in the Focal_occasion stands in for the occasion.  'My flight is early by 20 minutes.' 'I 'm late for my departure !'",
    "Releasing": "A Captor ends the captivity or inhibition of the motion of a Theme from the Location_of_confinement. The release is in accord with the plans of the Captor.  'They released me from prison on New Year's Day.'",
    "Releasing_from_custody": "The Authorities release a Suspect who has been held under suspicion of having committed a crime.",
    "Reliance": "A Protagonist needs a Means action performed for their Benefit.  The relevant Means action is often evoked only by reference to  an Intermediary who performs it. Also, if the Protagonist performs the Means action themselves, the Instrument that they use may be referred to in place of the Means Note that when one of the three interrelated FEs Means, Instrument and Intermediary is realized overtly, the other two are blocked from overt realization as clause-level arguments of the target.''  When the Protagonist is a sentient being, it is implied that they put their trust in the Intermediary to help in the achievement of the Benefit.   The extent to which the Protagonist is dependent on an Intermediary or Instrument can be indicated in a Degree phrase.''  A set of  Circumstances in which the Protagonist's need for the Benefit arises, may also be specified. ''   The difference between the Benefit that the Means action provides and the Purpose that the Protagonist has is very subtle. For our purposes we will assume that one can form a predication from Benefit and Means on the one hand, and Protagonist and Purpose on the other, but that they cannot be intermingled (cf. examples (7) and (8) below). With for-PPs such as in (6) it is not clear which FE they instantiate, Benefit or Purpose. We will arbitrarily call them Benefit''   '(1) I rely on you  to see that my name is not sullied.'  '(2) The system can rely entirely  on coaxial cable or entirely on optical fibre, just as a tree and  branch network can be based on either technology .'

    "Reliance_on_expectation": "A Cognizer takes a certain Expectation to be a reliable fact, such that their plans can be based on it.  'I can always count on him being late to work when it's raining.'",
    "Religious_belief": "A Believer has faith in a piece of Content or an Element  which fits into a religious belief system made up of many articles of faith. The Content is not necessarily tied to direct sensory experience. The system of beliefs may be enshrined by the members of a social group  'Do Muslims believe in the virgin birth of Jesus?' 'Muslims believe in only One God, the same God that Jews and Christians believe in, but some of the ideas about the nature of God are different' 'Muslims believe that the month of Ramadan is the holiest month of the year'",
    "Remainder": "A Resource is depleted by some process, resulting in there being only a Remainder in existence some time into or after the process. The original Resource may be indicated metonymically via reference to an Original_owner. The Location where the Resource is found may be expressed.  'There are only two poems left from Quayle' 'After the storm, only two houses were left DNI' 'Not much was left in the till' 'Nothing remained for the youngest brother from the inheritance' 'Only this school is left from the 1970s; all the other ones are newer.' ",
    "Remembering_experience": "A Cognizer calls up an episodic memory of past Experience or an Impression of a Salient_entity formed  on the basis of past experience. The Cognizer may also remember  the Salient_entity in a particular State, which serves as a frame of reference in the Cognizer's mind.   When attention is focused on a Salient_entity, then mention of a global Experience is excluded and typically, but not always, either a State or Impression of the Salient_entity is presented.  '' Episodic memory is the  explicit memory of events. It includes time, place, and associated emotions (which affect the quality of the memorization). Episodic memory contrasts and interacts with semantic memory, the memory of facts and concepts. The Remembering_information frame is concerned with this latter type of memory.   'Kozmo could remember when his modem was the fastest he could buy.'  'That's probably before my time, which was long time ago, Fish may remember that time.'  'Who remembers me being a total dork and going up to everyone saying \"Hey, I'm Ashley Hunt from Chicago\"!?!'   ' I wanted to remember how good that felt.'  'Hummel says staff, both students and professional, remember  her as a \"very good friend, available for new staff and well-respected by everyone.\"'   'Somehow I remember him as older, with long eyelashes, and doe eyes.'  'When he died he was just a kid himself but for some reason at the age of 44 I still remember him as older than me. '  'Retro games are great, but a lot of the time people get clouded by nostalgia and remember them to be better than they really were'  'He remembered him as a kindly man but not a very lively one. '  'The part I vividly remember was about a South Seas tramp steamer captain . '",
    "Remembering_information": "A Cognizer retains facts in memory and is able to retrieve them.  The Mental_content may be presented in clearly propositional form as a finite clause. It may also take the form of an embedded question or be a concealed question in the form of a simple NP.    ' I was impressed that she 'd actually remembered Radish 's name (= what Radish's name is) '    'Oh, and for those who like to continually whinge about how the French are 'surrender monkeys' - remember Napoleon (= who Napoleon was)?'  ' I ca n't remember what  DSP stands for.'  'And Bill can still remember the pattern (= what the pattern is). '  'What do you remember about your grandma?'  '' Notice that this frame is very general. It can be used to talk about detailed reports of past experience.  'I don't know if I lost consciousness for a while. But I remember that I was lying in the middle of the road with people trying to assist me.'  ''  Notice that Mental_content reported within this frame is presented as factive, i.e. as reliable and accurate. Consider the following contrasts:  '1a. I remember her as selfish--but I might be wrong.' '1b. ??I remember that she was selfish--but I might be wrong.'  '2a. Bill remembers her as smarter than she is.' '2b.*Bill remembers that she is smarter than she is.'  The (b) sentences, which belong in this frame, are less acceptable than the (a)-sentences as they suggest  that the Cognizer  takes their memory to be accurate while suggesting at the same time that the memory might be or is inaccurate. In the (a) sentences, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no contradiction as the remembering is taken to be subjective and not necessarily accurate. '' The concealed question uses with personal names that occur in this frame are not always easy to distinguish from instances of the Remembering_experience frame where a Salient_entity alone is referred to in 3a and 3b, which belong to the Remembering_experience frame, there is no question of identity: remembering here means thinking of one's memories of the relevant person. 3c is different: the hearer is asked whether they know who the person is; it belongs in this frame.  '3a. I remember her fondly' '3b. Please take a moment to remember Caesar and his Family.' '3c. Do you remember Alexander the Great? He was one of history's most prolific conquerors, and he did it all in his twenties.'  '' This frame differs from Remembering_to_do in that this frame is strictly talking about a fact, whereas the Remembering_to_do frame is strictly about tasks which the Cognizer would be expected to do.  Remembering_to_do uses normally occur with infinitival complements.",
    "Remembering_to_do": "A Cognizer thinks of and performs an Action that is a self- or other-imposed task or some other kind of desirable behavior. The Action may involve a Salient_entity in some way affected by the Cognizer. If a Salient_entity is mentioned, the Action is left unexpressed.   'You invited everybody but you forgot Harry.'  'Thank God Smithers remembered to return the video..'  'If you forget your textbook and there is an assignment to be done, the highest grade you will receive on the work is aC (70%).'  'Did you remember about the letter?'  ",
    "Removing": "An Agent causes a Theme to move away from a location, the Source.  The Sourceis profiled by the words in this frame, just as the Goal is profiled in the Placing frame.  'I saw that several men in dark suits had removed all of the evidence from the scene.' 'With your index finger prise the meat out of the shell' 'The torrential winds dislodged most of the roof tiles.'",
    "Removing_scenario": "The abstract scene in which an Agent affects a Source and a Theme so that the Theme ends up not co-located with the Source.",
    "Render_nonfunctional": "An Agent affects an Artifact so that it is no longer capable of performing its inherent function.  'I broke the TV.'",
    "Renting": "A Lessee gains the use of Goods owned by a Lessor by payment to the Lessor.  'We are renting our apartment from a kind man named Tom.'",
    "Renting_out": "A Lessor who owns some Goods allows a Lessee to use the Goods temporarily in exchange for Money.  'I rented my cabin to him.'",
    "Renunciation": "A Speaker declares that they will no longer be involved with the Content.  Such a declaration implies that the Speaker has decided that association with the Content is somehow undesirable.  'That will only be possible if and when the IRA renounces armed struggle.'  ",
    "Reparation": "The words in this frame describe the process of making amends for some (wrongful) action (the Injury) committed by the Wrongdoer.  In this process, in order to appease the Injured_party or to follow laws or customs, the Wrongdoer performs some Benefiting_action for the Injured_party or gives the Injured_party some Gift.  'I will make it up to you.' 'Sinn Fein said that the marchers had to make restitution to the Catholics for the disruption and violence.' 'The tribesmen tried to make amends to us with handfuls of their most precious seashells.'",
    "Repayment": "A Debtor gives a Loaner Money in return for having borrowed Money at an earlier time. Alternatively, the type of Loan can be expressed as the object of repayment.  'I am paying back $2,000 of my student loan to the government.'",
    "Repel": "A Defender successfully repels the aggressive attempt of takeover by an Enemy.  'We repelled the invaders.'",
    "Replacing": "An Agent changes the filler of a  Role by placing a New filler in the position after the Old filler ceases to occupy the position.  Often this entails the Agent removing the Old filler.  In most cases the Role is implicit.  'If you replace me with a robot, who's gonna make excuses to your wife for you?'  'Following Keating 's resignation from the Cabinet Hawke immediately replaced him as Deputy Prime Minister with Brian Howe , Minister for Community Services and Health.' ",
    "Reporting": "In this frame an Informer informs the Authorities of the illegal or otherwise improper Behavior of the Wrongdoer. ' Tony reported Michael to the police for breaking into his car. ' ' The teacher reported the bathroom vandalism. DNI '",
    "Representative": "A Representative is authorized by a Represented to communicate on behalf of the Represented.  'She is a representative for Pepsi.'",
    "Representing": "An Entity represents some Phenomenon through its existence and/or defining characteristics.  Sometimes a Cognizer, a people or group of people who believe in the representation, is expressed. 'A bear symbolizes strength in some cultures.'",
    "Request": "In this frame a Speaker asks an Addressee for something, or to carry out some action.  'The customer demanded a refund.' 'I begged my parents to let me stay up late.' ",
    "Request_entity": "A Customer requests an Entity from a Supplier.  The Customer can order the Entity himself or via a Medium.  '' 'I ordered a black scarf from J. Crew a week ago.' '' 'Mr. Strom's order has been cancelled.'",
    "Required_event": "Unless a particular Required_situation obtains, Negative_consequences will follow.  Alternatively, the Required_situation is required to achieve a Purpose (which avoids Negative_consequences). A set of Circumstances may be specified under which the requirement holds.  'You must turn in your test by 5 p.m.' 'You better have that fixed by tomorrow or else we'll fire you.' 'The book needs to be shorter to sell to such a young audience.'  Most, but not all, LUs of this frame are usable in a context that implies a duty or responsibility, concepts related to the Being_obligated frame. However, our analysis is that such interpretations are due to contextual pragmatic strengthening--in other words, a duty is a frequently salient type of purpose that has negative consequences if not achieved.",
    "Requirement_scenario": "One  state of affairs, the Dependent, cannot occur without another state of affairs, the Requirement, also obtaining.  This Requirement is construed to be under the control of some implicit force or actor.  In an alternative construal, the Dependent state of affairs may be presented as depending on the presence of a Required_entity. Individual that profit from the occurrence of the Dependent state, Dependent_individuals, are backgrounded. The same goes for individuals (Required_individual) that are required to provide any Required_entity or to see to the occurrence of the Dependent state of affairs.  The nexus between Requirement and Dependent can be qualified further in terms of the Degree of strength of the link between the two eventualities, the Place and Time where this nexus obtains, the Reason for its existence, or a specification of Condition when it applies.",
    "Rescuing": "An Agent saves a Patient or an Asset from a Harmful_situation.   'Israeli commandos rescued the hostages and left.'   'His German shepherd saved him from drowing once.'  'She saved my life on the bridge yesterday.'",
    "Research": "A Researcher (an individual a group or institution) attempts to answer a Question by means of consulting literature,  observation, or conducting experiments in a particular Field pertinent to the Question. The Question may be underspecified in the form of a Topic.   ' Simmons and Nadel did research pertaining to Ardea purpurea and Egretta garzetta in 1998'",
    "Reserving": "In this frame, a Booker brings about a situation where an Organization plans to provide Services to a Client at a particular Scheduled_time.  The Organization has authority over when Services are provided to whom.  The Booker usually has to communicate and negotiate with the Organization to plan the Services for a mutually agreeable Scheduled_time.  Usually, there is a Payment as well.  'We can book you a boatride on the Somme or a special tour of the Louvre .' 'Now booking trips to Cancunfor only $50 ! CNI INI'   In many cases, the Booker may be the same as the Client or the Organization. '' When the Booker is also the Organization providing the service, as in the first sentence below, we annotate Booker on the first layer and Organization on the second.  Realizing that the Booker is also the Organization providing the service is an inference, as we can see by comparing the following two examples.  In the first, it seems clear that the hotel is providing the service.  In the second, it is clear that the hotel is not providing the service.  'The hotel gave us a reservation for two nights .' 'The hotel gave us a reservation for two nights at the adjacent hotel to make up for screwing up our original booking .'  '' In the frequent case where the Booker is the same as the Client, we annotate Booker on the first layer and Client on the second.  Client is on the second layer since, in most cases, it is an inference that may be wrong.  For example, in the following sentence, the annotation indicates that Patrick is the Client.  However, it is also possible that Patrick is reserving a table for a party that doesn't even include himself:  'Patrick tried to reserve a table at Dorsia  for 7:00 .' 'Patrick tried to reserve a table at Dorsia for 7:00 .'",
    "Reshaping": "In this frame a Deformer deforms a Patient possibly against a Resistant_surface such that it undergoes a shape-change from its canonical or original shape into the Configuration, a new shape. Some of these words indicate that the Configuration is an undesirable alteration of the norm, and in such cases the lexical unit is marked with the semantic type Negative_judgement.   This frame does not include senses that specifically indicate causing harm to a living being.    'Ellen crumpled the paper into a ball.'   'Michael flattened the can against his head.'   'Mix butter and sardines very thoroughly , mashing them with a fork until you have a smooth paste. CNI'   'A killer hurricane nearly flattened Sylvester Stallone's five luxury homes in Hawaii.' ",
    "Residence": "This frame has to do with people (the Residents) residing in Locations, sometimes with a Co-resident.  'Peter lives in New York.' 'Sue is an inhabitant of Los Angeles.'",
    "Resolve_problem": "An Agent resolves an outstanding Problem by finding its solution, explanation, answer, etc.  Alternatively, some non-agentive Cause may resolve the Problem.  The Means, Degree, Time and Place may also be expressed.  'As it turns out, putting all of my eggs in one basket completely solved all of my problems.' 'Students finally worked through all of the difficult problems by working together.'",
    "Respond_to_proposal": "A Speaker addresses a Proposal made by an Interlocutor, either agreeing to it or rejecting it. Agreeing entails a social responsibility on the Speaker to bring about some state of affairs encoded in the Proposal.  'They were rebuffed again in the larger city of Provo. CNI '  'Last month Mr Duisenberg delivered a sharp rebuff to Mr Welteke. '  'He rebuffed Singh's every overture,  relentlessly pursuing a cap on India's nuclear capability.'",
    "Response": "An Agent performs a Response action in consequence of a Trigger event. In many cases, a non-agentive Responding_entity causes the Response after the Trigger occurs.  'I respond to earthquakes by hiding under my desk.'",
    "Response_scenario": "A Trigger elicits a Response by some Responding_entity or an Agent.  ",
    "Responsibility": "An Agent is responsible for having intentionally performed an Act or for being the or a primary instigator behind the Act. There is often a sense of negative evaluation of the Agent for having done so.  'It has been determined that a relatively unknown terrorist group is responsible for the recent attacks.'  Note: the noun responsibility in this frame frequently occurs with take and claim. These words are considered controllers (rather than supports), as they express events of communication rather than the static relationship of responsibility. ",
    "Rest": "One Part of a larger Whole has been mentioned, is inferrable, or is available in the discourse setting and the previously unmentioned part, the Rest, is now mentioned.  'The lenses , like the rest of the exoskeleton, are made of calcite.' 'They see social policy work as a natural complement to bureau work.'",
    "Result_of_attempt_scenario": "An Agent and their Action succeed or fail inasmuch as the result of an Action matches the Goal that they hope to bring about by the Action.",

    "Reveal_secret": "A Speaker reveals Information that was previously secret to an Addressee. In some cases, the Addressee is expected to keep the Information from other parties. The Information may be damaging to the reputation of the Speaker. Instead of (or in addition to) a Speaker, a Medium may also be mentioned. Likewise, a Topic may be stated instead of Information. Some lexical units in this frame imply that the Addressee has already been confronted with the Information.    'Could it be true that Martin himself was the one who spilled the beans on Pops and Brad's planned wedding? '  ",
    "Revenge": "This frame concerns the infliction of punishment in return for a wrong suffered. An Avenger performs a Punishment on a Offender as a consequence of an earlier action by the Offender, the Injury. The Avenger inflicting thePunishment need not be the same as the Injured_Party who suffered the Injury,  but the Avenger does have to share the judgment that the Offender's action was wrong. The judgment that the Offender had inflicted an Injury  is made without regard to the law.  '(1) They took revenge for the deaths of two loyalist prisoners.' '(2) Lachlan went out to avenge them.' '(3) The next day, the Roman forces took revenge on their enemies..'",
    "Revolution": "An Agent brings about a radical change in leadership by removing the Current_leadership and potentially dismantling the Current_order, outside recognized means of doing so (e.g., elections).  'Recent reports indicate that the local troops have mutinied against their superiors.'",
    "Rewards_and_punishments": "An Agent (the punisher or rewarder) performs a Response_action on an Evaluee for a Reason, the Evaluee's actions or beliefs.   Means and Instrument may also be indicated. The goal of the punishment/reward is  to discourage/encourage the actions or beliefs.  Words in this frame presuppose that a judgment of the Evaluee has occurred and that the Evaluee is (or becomes) aware of the judgment.  This judgment was performed by a cognizer which is either the same as the Agent, or, minimally, a representative of the same institution.  'His punishment of the prisoners was too harsh.' 'Her punishment  was too harsh.' 'The penalty for this crime is death. ' 'I believe that this behaviour should be subject to disciplinary action.'",
    "Ride_vehicle": "In this frame a Theme is moved by a Vehicle which is not directly under their power. The Source, Path, Goal, or Area of the motion may be indicated. The Distance traveled or the Speed of motion may also be indicated. A Route or Roadmay be present and the Manner in which the Theme moves may be given. 'Mrs. Smith rode on the train.' 'Sally flew 3000 miles from San Francisco to New York.' 'Every day, Martin rode the bus on highway 880.' 'Mr. Bigglesworth rides route 51.'  There is shared vocabulary between this frame and Carrying and Operate_vehicle. It is differentiated from Operate_vehicle in that the vehicle is not under the subject's control. It is differentiated from Carrying because the vehicle is not being used to transport goods.",
    "Rising_to_a_challenge": " A Protagonist, by exerting great effort, comes to meet the pre-conditions for participating in an Activity that is judged to be difficult for them to participate in, either due to their inherent properties or due to temporary Circumstances.   'In conclusion, our staff rose to the challenge in developing the necessary training programs and delivery methods.'  'Dr Runcie rose to the occasion with a simple address. DNI'  'There was still clearly much to do, but the governor and his staff had begun to rise to the task.'  'Pacers say they'll rise to the pressure.'",
    "Risk_scenario": "An Asset is in a particular Situation, which has a likelihood of leading to or inviting a Harmful_event which will negatively affect the Asset.",
    "Risky_situation": "A particular Situation is likely (or unlikely) to result in a harmful event befalling an Asset. The Situation may be a state, an activity, or some focal entity that must be inferred to be part of some larger Situation involving both it and the Asset. Although the idea of a harmful event is crucial to the understanding of this frame, it is not expressible as an argument of the LUs in this frame.  'Is climate change dangerous for mankind?' 'Customers can make complaints about unsafe products.' 'The primary risk is to our infrastructure.'   See the Run_risk frame for discussion on differentiation regarding the noun risk.",
    "Rite": "This frame concerns rituals performed in line with religious beliefs or tradition.  'In certain fertility rites in Burma , a woman desirous of offspring is required not only to approach the King Cobra but to plant a kiss on its mouth .'  'He was ordered a priest in 1944. CNI '",
    "Roadways": "This frame involves stable Roadways which connect two stable Endpoints, the Source and the Goal.  Being physical objects, these Roadways may have Names and Characteristics; they are also made of a Material.  They also cover ground, so they may have a Path or a Relative_location that the travel occurs in.  ' We crossed the brick road.' ' I prefer to travel on highway I-80.'  'This is the only highway between Lodi and Sonoma.' ' She dreaded turning onto the busy street.'",
    "Robbery": "These are words describing situations in which a Perpetrator wrongs a Victim by taking something (Goods) from them.  In some cases, the Source location from which the Goods were taken is used to metonymically refer to the Victim.  The robbery can be done in a particular Manner (for example, forcefully) and via a specific Means (for example, by threatening the Victim).  'Half of the team held up the tellers while the others were stationed to report the arrival of police.'  As opposed to Theft, Robbery focuses on the harm to the Victim and on the Source location from which the Goods have been removed, rather than the Goods themselves.",
    "Rope_manipulation": "An Agent manipulates a linear entity (the Rope) to form a Knot.  'Harry tied the rope into a slipknot.' 'Patty and Selma knotted the ties of their aprons.' ",
    "Rotting": "In this frame a Patient, which is  an organic substance, undergoes the natural process of decaying from an Initial_state to a Result.  'The leaves rotted into a mass of slime.' 'The dresses decayed from their former beauty.'",
    "Run_risk": "A Protagonist is described as being exposed to a potentially dangerous situation that may end in a Bad_outcome for him- or herself.  An Asset which is in danger of loss may stand in for the Bad_outcome. There is no implication that the Protagonist intentionally exposes themself to the risky situation. The Protagonist may be attempting to achieve some Purpose, which involves being in a dangerous situation. The Severity of risk involved may also be expressed.  'There was a risk of fire.' 'Original thinkers incur greater risks to their careers than their pedestrian colleagues.'  NOTE: This Frame is currently in the process of being changed so that some instances of at risk.n will be moved to the Being_at_risk frame, and some will be moved to the Risky_situation frame. In the Being_at_risk frame, risk is almost always supported with at, and its external argument is the Asset. Risky_situation uses of risk include the following:  'Smoking poses a risk to your health.' 'Smoking is a health risk.' 'The most imminent risk is to our infrastructure.'  but (possibly ; still under discussion) not: The most imminent RISK is that our infrastructure may not be able to handle the load.  In the Risky_situation frame, the external argument is the Situation, and the Bad_outcome in not expressible.  The verb risk.v will remain in the Run_risk frame, in the sense of <em>he risked his life for his country</em>. The construction run risk also will remain in the Run_risk frame.",
    "Sacrificing_for": "An Agent sacrifices an (often abstract) Asset in exchange for a Benefit which is deemed better or more worth having.  'We never sacrifice quality for price.'  'What are you willing to sacrifice to get a chance at winning?'  'Most people in that position probably would have compromised their principles. INI.'",
    "Satisfying": "This frame describes an Agent or an Entity meeting or not meeting a Standard.  Alternatively, an action or occurrence may be construed as an Event that meets or fails to meet the Standard. 'Will my coursework satisfy the requirements for admission?' 'He satisfied his son's wish by buying him a Wii.'",
    "Scarcity": "The Quantity of a Collection occurring in a Place has a particular Measure, which is related to the amount generally needed.  'There is evidence that volatile materials have always been scarce on the Moon .'  'A global effort to tackle water scarcity is getting underway. INI'  'It is the scarceness of these precious metals that adds to their luster. INI'  ",
    "Scheduling": "An Agent schedules an Event to take place at a specified Scheduled_time and Place.  'Gina scheduled a dentist appointment for Monday in Berkeley.'  'Christa set up an afternoon meeting to discuss the new prototype.'",
    "Scope": "An Event is described in terms of the diversity of entities that are affected or considered in the Event. Alternatively a Salient_entity which enables or brings about the Event can be similarly described.  'The U.S. government believes that China has not revealed the full scope of its program.' 'A key question is how U.S. deployment of ballistic missile defense will affect the pace and scope of Chinese strategic modernization.'",
    "Scouring": "A Searcher looks all over a Ground in order to find a Sought_entity. The Sought_entity is not presupposed to exist. The search activity is not concerned with the state of the Ground, which is the case in the Inspecting frame, but only with the finding of the Sought_entity, which is desirable.   'The newcomers combed the area looking for minerals' 'Scientists scoured the ice samples  for signs of life. ' 'Mulder rummaged through his toilet kit for a plastic razor.'",
    "Scrutinizing_for": "A Cognizer examines a Ground closely, alert to the presence of a Phenomenon.  ",
    "Scrutiny": "This frame concerns a Cognizer (a person or other intelligent being) paying close attention to something, the Ground, in order to discover and note its salient characteristics.  The Cognizer may be interested in a particular characteristic or entity, the Phenomenon, that belongs to the Ground or is contained in the Ground (or to ensure that such a property of entity is not present).  Some words in this frame allow alternate expressions of the Groundand the Phenomenon: 'We searched the yard  for my contact lens.'",
    "Searching_scenario": "A Cognizer seeks a Phenomenon within the Ground.",
    "Secrecy_status": "A Phenomenon, which may be an activity, state or object, is purposefully hidden from the awareness of a potential Cognizer. The person responsible for the hiding of the Phenomenon is not part of this frame and cannot be syntactically realized. The potential Cognizer may be realized, but is in fact rarely expressed. A period of Time during which the Phenomenon is secret may be indicated.   'Few people would use ATMs if the content of their transaction was secret from their bank and there was no paper trail verifying the transaction. .'  'The protesters were not on her list, and weren't allowed in, despite the fact that the meeting was public.'  'Student disciplinary matters are confidential and should only be discussed with appropriate university officials'",
    "See_through": "A Cognizer realizes that a State_of_affairs (or Focal_entity within the State_of_affairs) is meant to deceive (the Cognizer is not necessarily the intended victim of the deception). The Cognizer comes to this belief by perception and reasoning, and not, for instance, by being informed of the true state of affairs.",
    "Seeking": "A Cognizer_agent attempts to find some Sought_entity by examining some Ground.  The success or failure of this activity (the Outcome) may be indicated.  NB:  This frame should be compared to the Scrutiny frame, in which the primary focus is on the Ground.  'John looked for his pencil.'",
    "Seeking_to_achieve": "An Agent intends and takes steps towards bringing about a State_of_affairs or, metonymically, towards acquiring a Sought_entity .  'Libya sought nuclear weapons in the 1960s.'  'North Korea sought several billion dollars in cash from the US during bilateral missile talks.'  'The talks in Berlin ended without agreement after Bora Bora sought to link large-scale economic assistance to joint recovery operations.'  'India had sought her extradition for forging documents to procure a passport.'",
    "Self_control": "An Agent actively (yet not always with success) attempts to keep themselves from participating in an Event. The Agent is usually pushed to the Event because of an internal urge. '' 'He couldn't help but peek.'",
    "Self_motion": "The Self_mover, a living being, moves under its own direction along a Path. Alternatively or in addition to Path, an Area, Direction, Source, or Goal for the movement may be mentioned.   'She walked along the road for a while.'  Many of the lexical units in this frame can also describe the motion of vehicles (e.g., as external arguments). We treat these as belonging in this frame.   'The cars scooted slowly towards the intersection.'  Self_motion most prototypically involves individuals moving under their own power by means of their bodies. Many words also specify the manner of motion (swim, walk). This frame contains mostly words that fit this prototypical scenario, but the frame itself does not specify whether a separate vehicle is impossible, necessary, or unspecified. Lexical units that involve separate vehicles are associated with FEs that are not appropriate for the more general case of motion, so they are placed in the Operate_vehicle or Ride_vehicle frames (e.g., He drove across the country, She flew to Europe).",
    "Sending": "A Sender plans the Path (along with Source and Goal) of a Theme and places it in circumstances such that it travels along this Path under the power of some entity other than the Sender.  This frame also has a Recipient distinct from the Goal, as both can be present: 'I sent the manuscript to England to Bill.' 'I forwarded the grain to a dealer in Frankfurt.'  This frame contains verbs that participate in the ditransitive construction, with a recipient as the direct object, as in the following: 'I sent Bill the manuscript.' Certain Verbs in this Frame focus on the initial sending act, while others do not.  For example, I sent it rapidly can either mean the act of sending was initiated quickly or that it moved quickly. However, the in following sentence: I exported/dispatched it rapidly, meaning that the act was begun quickly, both types of verbs are included.",
    "Sensation": "This frame contains nouns that refer to sensations in different modalities. The FE Source is used for the phenomenon that gives rise to the sensation in question. The FE Percept is used for the characteristic quality of the sensation. In cases of veridical perception these are not typically distinguished from one another; we use the FE Percept as the default in these cases. With some nouns in this frame it is possible to express the being who experiences the sensation, or the part of the body of such a being. We mark such expressions with the FEs Perceiver_passive and Body_part, respectively. (The -passive part of this label serves to distinguish this FE from the Perceiver-Agentive FE used in other frames.)  '' 'The huge sand dunes, perpetually changing, make for a surreal sight.'  'Endill heard the noise of glass smashing, plaster crumbling and furniture being broken.'  'The feel of his strong fingers enclosing her small palm came as something of a shock to her system.'",
    "Sent_items": "A Sent_item is prepared for, received after, or involved in a process of Sending, which may involve a particular kind of Transport_means. The Sent_item has an (intended or actual) Sender and Recipient (or a Source and Goal). As a physical object, the Sent_item can be located in a Place.  'The shipment from Romania is destined for the Iraqi Police Forces.'  'Postage became more affordable and mail to the President gradually increased.'  'I 'll arrange for her to collect Bertha 's mail.'  'i am looking for a penpal for email or snail mail.'  'He had plenty of time to read all his fan mail from Australia while there.' ",
    "Sentencing": "During a court appearance, a Sentence, generally a punishment, is imposed on the Convict by a Court, usually represented by a judge.  'The judge sentenced Martha Stewart to 2 years in prison for insider trading.'",
    "Separating": "These words refer to separating a Whole into Parts, or separating one part from another.  The separation is made by an Agent or Cause and may be made on the basis of some Criterion.   'I divided the class into groups in alphabetical order .'",
    "Sequence": "The words in this frame describe entities that occur in some temporally-ordered sequence.  The entities thus have some sort of relation between them that might be described by the Relative_time frame.  However, at this time, this frame has no Frame Relation with that frame (though this is still under discussion).  Additionally, it should be noted that the words in this frame have a metaphorical link to the words in Shape.  'Describe in detail the sequence of steps taken during an emergency.'  ",
    "Serving_in_capacity": "An Agent occupies a Role in some institution. This Roleis (usually) temporary and can be occupied by other entities at different periods of time. It is common for a Duration of the Role to be mentionned.  '' 'Chris served as chairman of the boardfor one year.' ",
    "Set_of_interrelated_entities": "A group of Component_entities along with their interrelations is viewed as a Complex.   'By definition, no external forces act upon an isolated system of particles.'  'Earth is a contained system which receives energy from the sun.'",
    "Set_relation": "A Superset has several members, a part of which is the Subset. This frame exists largely for the purposes of inheritance.",
    "Setting_back_burn": "A Firefighter sets a controlled fire to remove fuel from a currently incompletely controlled fire.",
    "Setting_fire": "This frame describes either the creation of a Flame by a Kindler or non-sentient Cause, or the igniting of Flammables by a Kindler or a Cause.  'Taliban militants recently set fire to several schools.'  'The fire ignited. CNI' ",
    "Setting_out": "A Self_mover begins a journey at a Source location, in a particular Directiongenerally setting out with an Intended_goal in mind.  'At about 1:00 in the morning, climbers set out for the summit.' 'The expedition set out from Granada early in March, leaving only one hundred men to garrison the fort which overlooks the city.' 'After that the earl set out south with his host, and Kari went with him, and Njal's sons too.'",
    "Severity_of_offense": "In this frame an Offense is described in terms of the legal or other punishing action that can be taken in response to the offense. ' He committed an indictable crime . '",
    "Sex": "Participants in a Sex act engage in or are subjected to sexual contact. Often the LUs in this frame are suggestive euphemisms which refer to non-sexual physical contact, Giving/Receiving scenarios, frames related to travel, physical orientation, body metonymy, biological necessity, or a simple completion of Activity.  ",
    "Sexual_reproduction_scenario": "This frame embodies the process of procreation.",
    "Shaped_part": "An entity is a shaped Part of a larger Whole. The Part may correspond in form and  function  to a part of another entity. For instance, the leg of a table supports the weight of a table like the leg of an animal or person supports their weight. The Orientation of the Part relative to the Whole may be expressed.  'I removed the brim of the hat'  'Bill likes to chew the waxy rind of the cheese'",
    "Shapes": "This frame contains words which describe the dimensional extent and Shape of a Substance.  These words do not make reference to a Part-whole relationship. There can also be a descriptor of the Shape, Shape_prop.  'She held a square of cloth .'",
    "Sharing": "In this frame Protagonist_1 and Protagonist_2, collectively Protagonists, allow one another to partake jointly the use of an Entity .     'More than half of the group shared needles.'  'I shared the cake with the ladies at the DAR meeting.'",
    "Sharpness": "An Entity has a Sharpness characterized by its capability to cut.  The Sharpness is a value of the Attribute of sharpness.  'That axe seems dangerously sharp.'",
    "Shoot_projectiles": "An Agent causes a Firearm to discharge which induces the rapid motion of the Projectile.  'The bank robber shot at the clerks with an AK-47.' 'Shooting a cannonball isn't as easy as it looks.  CNI'  Note that usages with the Firearm as object are out of frame, belonging to Use_firearm.",
    "Shooting_scenario": "A firearm is discharged, causing the motion of a projectile.  This frame exists primarily to relate frames.",
    "Shopping": "A Shopper looks for Goods in order to purchase them.  'She shopped for a new hat.'",
    "Short_selling": "Short selling, a common financial market concept, involves an Intermediary selling Assets to the Market, having borrowed these Assets from a (generally implicit) Lender. The Intermediary is obligated to rebuy the Assets later, so that they may be returned to the Lender. The Intermediary's intent is to repurchase the Assets from the Market at a lower price than when he sold them, and so return them to the Lender for a profit. '' Because this strategy only makes sense when the Intermediary believes that the value of the Assets is lower than the valuation assigned by other members of the market, words of this frame may be used metaphorically to refer to an Agent (usually wrongly) believing some Entity is worth less than other people do.  'He was selling short shares from his brother's company on the NASDAQ and he made a fortune.'",
    "Sidereal_appearance": "An Astronomical_entity comes into view above the horizon as part of a regular, periodic process of (apparent) motion of the Astronomical_entity across the sky. In the case of the sun, the appearance begins the day.  'Venus rose at 5:23 AM, twenty minutes before the sun which reached the horizon at 5:43 AM.'  'At the time of the new moon, the moon rises at about the same time the sun rises, and it sets at about the same time the sun sets.'  'And, as the sun came up over the trees, it became golden, and then turned again into a silvery path; and the water came alive'  'Each day the sun's rise offers us a new day.'",
    "Sign": "A phenomenon, the Indicator, exists as an indication of another phenomenon, the Indicated. The relationship is asymmetric: the Indicated is not necessarily a sign for the existence or presence of an Indicator. The Indicated can be a past, present, or future entity or eventuality. The relationship between Indicator and Indicated is not one of symbolization or iconicity. Rather the Indicator is an index of the Indicated.  'This is a sign of things to come.'",
    "Sign_agreement": "A Signatory signs an Agreement document, thereby taking on a commitment encoded in the Agreement.  '. During this time, 84 countries (including the United States) signed the Protocol.' ",
    "Silencing": "An Agent causes a Speaker to become silent, sometimes about a particular Topic.  'The teacher quieted the children's laughter.'",
    "Similarity": "Two or more distinct entities, which may be concrete or abstract objects or types, are characterized as being similar to each other.  Depending on figure/ground relations, the entities may be expressed in two distinct frame elements and constituents , Entity_1 and Entity_2, or jointly as a single frame element and constituent, Entities.  The similarity may be based on appearance, physical properties, or other characteristics of the two entities. However, no such Dimension has to  be specified explicitly.  The Entities may be like each other to a greater or lesser Degree. Rather than specifying the Dimension of difference, a Differentiating_fact may be mentioned.   '' Notice that, although similarity presupposes the notion of a judge who assesses similarity, that judge is not part of the frame of similarity.  'A mulberry is very similar in shape  to a loganberry' 'Recovering it afterwards can also be similar to collecting an unsecured loan ' 'Great Britain and Germany were only alike in one respect.' 'Lothlorien is quite like most of their other war games really.'",
    "Simple_name": "A Term is the linguistic sign conventionally used by a Speaker to refer to a type of Entity.  ' Perianth is a collective term for the outer whorls of the flower, which protect the reproductive parts during development.'  'The Polish word for it is czarnuszka'",
    "Simple_naming": "A Speaker conventionally uses a particular Term to refer to an Entity.  'The pattern of conservation is similar to that found in C1_1, therefore we have termed this domain DC1 for divergent C1 domain.'",
    "Simultaneity": "Two Events happen at the same time.  This may either be construed symmetrically as a relation holding between the Events, or asymmetrically as holding between a Landmark_event whose known occurrence is used to describe when a Profiled_event took place.  'These events coincided.'",
    "Size": "The size of an Entity is assessed in terms of the Degree by which it deviates from the norm. The size generally refers to the amount of three-dimensional space that is occupied by the Entity, not primarily to its weight, density, or length, which is why it is peculiar to refer to a bullet as \"large\", even if it is heavy, unless it actually has larger dimensions than usual, or to a rope as \"big\", even if it is long, unless its other, cross-sectional dimensions are also significant.  'I own a very small home.' 'Where is my little notebook?' 'That dog is huge!' ''  There are an enormous number of productive metaphors that involve this frame as the source domain; two of the most frequent metaphors come from the target domains of quantity/amount and importance.    'He gave me a small sum of money.' 'The novel was a substantial achievement.' ''  Subcases of the quantity/amount and importance metaphors are also prominent. These involve cases describing the extent of an action's, event's, or person's effect (\"his influence on her work was massive\"), as well as those related to events (\"big party\"), similarity (\"gigantic difference\"), communication (\"giant misunderstanding\"), and emotions (\"great joy\", \"little joys\").  Other productive metaphors include those dealing with groups (in terms of their number of members, net worth, importance to the economy, i.e. \"giant electronics company\") and those describing sound volume (\"in a tiny voice\", \"the enormous thundering of her heart\").  ''  The target domain of fame, by contrast, occurs in a non-productive metaphor, found especially with big.a and huge.a. Maturity and age also occur in non-productive metaphors (\"big boy\", \"little baby\").",
    "Sleep": "The Sleeper stays in an altered state of consciousness with greatly reduced external awareness.  'We slept.'",
    "Sleep_wake_cycle": "A Sleeper enters a state of consciousness of reduced external awareness, remains in this state for some amount of time, and (normally) returns to full wakeful consciousness.",
    "Smuggling": "The words in this frame describe situations in which the Perpetrator secretly takes Goods into or out of a country or other area which are prohibited by law or on which one has not paid the required duty.  'He smuggled the bottle through customs.'",
    "Soaking": "In this frame, an Agent places the Theme in the Medium for an extended period of time, with the intent that the Theme will be affected by and absorb some of the Medium. ' Ellen soaked the beans in the water for 30 seconds.'",
    "Soaking_up": "An Item becomes filled with a Substance as a result of movement of liquid into visible or invisible interstices in the Item.  'Paper and board absorb moisture in the winter.'  'A stable soil soaks up water.'  ",
    "Sociability": "These words describe how outgoing or sociable a Protagonist is judged to be by a (usually implicit) Judge, often in a particular context, either with certain people (the Company), or about a particular situation, topic or event (the Content).    As opposed to the Social_interaction_evaluation frame, this frame talks about how much someone interacts, not how well. '' 'He was shy with strangers and afraid of showing his feelings.'  'Unfortunately he's very gregarious.'",
    "Social_behavior_evaluation": "In this frame the Behavior is judged by the speaker (or, in some cases, a separate Judge) against pre-existing social standards for that type of behavior.  An Individual who is involved in the Behavior is assigned the same evaluation as the Behavior.  This is an abstract frame that encodes the relationship between such frames as Mental_property, Sociability, Social_interaction_evaluation, Stinginess, and Volubility.",
    "Social_connection": "A mutual social and personal relationship that keeps people involved in each other's lives comprises a Connection of Individual1 to Individual2 or between Individuals.  'They wanted to strengthen their family ties.'  ",
    "Social_desirability": "This frame contains LUs which are like those of the Desirability frame except the Evaluee incorporates the Parameter as \"associated with a percieved place in a social heirarchy\" for all LUs. LUs are not restricted to positive or negative implications.  'His manner of dress was pedestrian but tidy.'",
    "Social_event": "A Social_event occurs at which Attendees are present to conduct a social function or joint activity.  The Social_event is often a party or celebration, in which case it is possible to express someone who is being honored (the Honoree) or its function may be to celebrate an Occasion at which Attendees are present. Often, a specific Attendee, the Host, provides a venue for people to gather.  'Sue threw a party for Bob's birthday.'  'Who will host the Olympic games in eight years?'",
    "Social_event_collective": "This frames describes a social event where there may or may not be a permanent or semi-permanent relationship between participants. Additionally, participants in this frame are expressed in one representative FE, Attendees.  Note the difference between this frame and Social_event_individuals, where participants are grammatically separated.  'Our date yesterday was interrupted by my ex-boyfriend!'",
    "Social_event_individuals": "This frames describes a social event where there may or may not be a permanent or semi-permanent relationship between participants. Additionally, participants in this frame are expressed separately, as Party_1 and Party_2.  Note the difference between this frame and Social_event_collective, where participants are grouped into one collective grammatical constituent and FE.  'I went out with him on Friday.'",
    "Social_interaction_evaluation": "In this frame an Evaluee is judged by a (usually implicit) Judge to be of a certain character based on her or his Behavior towards other human beings; a specific Affected_party may be overtly mentioned along with the Degree to which the Evaluee behaves appropriately towards others. TheBehavior alone may be mentioned with the understanding that these behaviors characterize a property of the unmentioned Evaluee. The Evaluee's Behavior may be in the context of a Topic.  ' It was nice of you to send a card. '   ' Jim was thoughtful to email the directions.'   ' For Martha to smoke in the car was extremely inconsiderate.'   ' It was cruel that he continued to call her.'   ' Mary was cruel to her friends.'   ' Samson was a thoughtless person.'   'Mrs. Robinson was always considerate of her students.'   ' The press was always kind about Madonna.'   ' Lee was nice about my car accident.'   ' I appreciated his kind offer of the car.'",
    "Socially_significant_history_scenario": "A series of Events are important to humankind and its culture.     ",
    "Sole_instance": "An Item is the only instance of its Type. 'Steven is the sole survivor in his family.'",
    "Sound_level": "An Entity is judged by a sound Attribute of some perceived level of Volume intensity.  'The radio is very loud.'",
    "Sound_movement": "A Sound emitted by a  Sound_source, which construed as a single point, moves along a Path. Rather than the Sound_source itself, the Location_of_sound_source may be mentioned. Essentially, this frame denotes the (semi-)fictive motion of the the Sound. Given the spreading nature of sound vibrations, it is not surprising that there usually is no expression of any particular Goal. '' 'Her shouts echoed around the cylinder formed by the walls.'  'She heard her name called from below, the sound distorted as it echoed from the depths.'  'Her voice echoed flatly from hollow walls.'  ",
    "Sounds": "This frame is  concerned with the percepts that vibrations which travel through the air or another medium produce in hearing organs. Sounds are a subtype of sensation. In talking about sounds, speakers often provide information about how the sound was produced. A Noisy_event may be mentioned which gives rise to the sound. Alternatively, the sound may be attributed to a Sound_source, which is construed as a point source emitting the sound. A further possible specification of what gives rise to the sound is for speakers to talk about two physical entities coming into contact by motion, resulting in either friction or impact.   Although this frame is defined in terms of a phenomenon of objective reality, many instances of the LUs in this frame are metonymic references to purely psychological phenomena due to a strong metaphorical relationship between external and internal reality. Furthermore, many of the LUs in this frame such as chuckle.n or whimper.n require a perceiver's analysis of a sound rather than being purely descriptive.  'I awoke to the clash of a jackhammer on concrete.'",
    "Source_of_getting": "A Goal has a Source from which it has gotten a Theme. The Goal may be a sentient recipient who has actively obtained the Theme but it may also  be a non-sentient entity that gets the Theme as a result of natural or other processes that it does not control.    'she is my friend...not to mention my source for French madeleines!'  'Pakistan informed IAEA and US officials investigating the network that North Korea was the source of the uranium shipment DNI.'  'The state remains the dominant source of research funding. INI '   'This is not true according to our source. DNI'  ''  Note that we also take this frame to cover as metaphorical uses those cases where a person has obtained <b>information</b> from another person or a textual source, which they typically intend to disseminate further.  ' Crews was held in contempt and ordered to jail after refusing to reveal his source for the claim that Big Basket Weaving is circumventing import tariffs on reed. '    ",
    "Source_path_goal": "Basic Image Schema: the Trajector moves (or is conceived as moving) from the Source along the Path to the Goal using the Means.",
    "Spatial_co-location": "A Figure is located essentially at the same location as a Ground, which is viewed as point-like, or having no important internal or external structure.  Typically, the Ground is viewed as point-like due to its small size with respect to a conversationally relevant spatial scale; this scale may be provided by reference to other, distant entities or full paths of travel that make the size of the Ground seem relatively small.  Another use of this frame is to specify a location via a Ground that is primarily considered for its function, rather than its shape; this second use explains why \"at the store\" is typically used even when a Figure is inside the Ground, but only in cases where the store is considered, according to its prototype, as a place to buy and sell, rather than an architectural entity (in which case \"in the store\" would be more usual).  'We are now at the cathedral .' 'They claim that many Christians were martyred at the Collosseum .' 'I 'm at my mother 's .'  This frame has a very large family of productive metaphors associated with it, the foremost of which maps from the target meaning of values on a quantitive scale (e.g. price, temperature, speed) onto the source domain of vertically-arranged positions in space.  Because this metaphor does not normally serve to locate a cognitive agent, it is only rarely and exceptionally usable with the LU here.adv, which implies being at the same location as the speaker. A separate metaphor maps the target meaning of quantified progress (measured by a quantity associated with a processed entity vs. a quantity associated with what is left to be done) onto the source domain of forward-backward-arranged positions in space.  ' Tesla stock is at a three-month low today .' 'She put the biscuits in the oven at only 400 degrees .' 'At fifty dollars , everyone 's gonna buy one !' 'If you 're only at page 20 , just start over .' ",
    "Spatial_contact": "A Figure is located in contact with a Ground.  With some words that evoke this frame, the Figure is also asserted to be fully or partially supported by the Ground (e.g. on), while in others a support relation is either denied (e.g. to, as in \"she put her hand to the wall\") or unspecified (e.g. against).  In addition, some LUs assert a direction in which to find the Figure from the Ground (e.g. atop).  'There was a tight-fitting lid on the bottle .' 'Against the back wall stood a young black man staring at his shoes .' 'Against the back wall three students were reading .' 'Clean if the jewelery is ever in contact with water or chlorine .'  This frame participates in productive metaphor cases, like \"shining a light on corruption\", \"Stalin's hand lay heavy on the presses\", \"it touched her heart\" in each of which an abstract entity affects another entity as if they were in physical contact. ''  This frame is intended to cover the description of writing, images, or situations being depicted on a document, canvas, screen, or other flat surface, including metaphorical cases where there is no literal document, like \"on record\" or \"pretty low on my list\". 'They were arguing on screen .' 'Watching chess is pretty low on my list .'  The use of on.prep to describe use of a vehicle is not included in this frame even though it does involve contact and support. The sense distinction is proven by the omissability of the Ground only in the vehicle cases: 'She is already on (the bus/the ship...) .' 'My paper is on *(the desk) .' This use is related to Ride_vehicle.  A similar argument holds for uses of on.prep with a clothing Figure, which virtually always omits the Ground; see Wearing. ''  The use of on.prep and upon.prep for Topics is considered a non-productive metaphor (see Topic).  No other target in the frame allows the use, nor is is correlated with other language of the source domain of contact (e.g. stand, sit, lie, put, rest). ",
    "Speak_on_topic": "A Speaker addresses an Audience on a particular Topic.  The Audience is generally passive, although for many types of address (including academic talks and press conferences), a discussion or question-answer period is virtually always required.  'McNamara addressed congress on the state of affairs of the Department of Defense.'",
    "Specific_individual": "LUs in this frame denote that the Instance of a Type is contextually notable.  This frame typically requires dual FE layer annotation; see below.  'I contrived to acquire a particular vintage of Merlot'   'I contrived to acquire a particular vintage of Merlot' ",
    "Speed_description": "An Entity is in motion  at a particular Speed, a momentaneous description of distance traveled per time.     'The car went by real  fast.'  'The car is really fast.'  'Oh yeah, Maseratis are fast! INI'  'The speed of the car was 25 mph when it ran into the obstacle.'  LUs of this frame are commonly involved in a semantic construction in which, instead of describing the current Speed, they rather describe some other Speed saliently associated with the Entity, such as maximum possible Speed of the Entity or (for an Entity used as an implement) Speed when in operation.    This construction can be defined as follows:  A phrase describing a temporary (stage-level) property (A) of an entity (B) is pumped to a phrase describing an individual-level property predicating or attributing the entity's (B's) salient association with such a property (A) under some salient conditions, especially the conditions of use of the entity.  E.g., in the Temperature or Location_of_light frames:  'I can never bake anything in my oven because it 's too hot.' 'She gave him a really bright flashlight for Christmas.'",
    "Spelling_and_pronouncing": "A Speaker realizes a Sign, usually a linguistic one, in some Formal_realization. The Formal_realization may be described as correct or incorrect in a Judgment expression, or it may be partially indicated as a Part_of_form.  Manner may be used as a more general indication of the Formal_realization  'A person doesn't always pronounce a word the way they say  it in context'  'I can't spell. INI INI'  'Stephanopolous spells his name with a \"ph\".'  'On page 87465, you spelled the name of my dog incorrectly as \"Checquers\".'  'In German, the word for 'peace' is written \"Friede\" CNI'",
    "Sports_jargon": "This frame contains LUs that have to do with the terminology used in competitive sports until a more complete, domain specific series of frames are created for the respective sport. This frame is a placeholder for these terms, as they properly belong is more specific frames related to their particular sports. However, these sports would require many complex frames and as such are low-priority for FrameNet.  'His serve was superb.'",
    "Stage_of_progress": "An Entity is at a particular stage of its development.  ' The Next Generation Internet (NGI) Program has been successfully completed.'  'Osama bin Laden, prime suspect in the US terror attacks, is outfoxing intelligence agencies with his low-tech communication methods.' 'Kids are much more advanced today than they were in our era that is for sure.'",
    "Standing_by": "A Protagonist waits for an Expected_request, and is prepared to respond to the request when it comes by engaging in an Activity. Alternatively, the Protagonist waits for a Salient_entity involved in the request, most often realized as the person making the request.  'Police have been standing by for further orders regarding the protesters for over two hours.'  'Our staff are on call 24 hours a day.'",
    "State": "An Entity persists in a stable situation called a State",
    "State_continue": "Despite some implication that a State would be interrupted, the Entity remains in the specified State. Note that State includes locative relations.  'Online security remains elusive.' ''",
    "State_of_entity": "An Entity is in a specified State. When not explicitly specified, the State usually concerns the Entity's health, repair, or functioning. The State is also often assessed with an Evaluation and it may be specified to apply only to a particular  Parameter of the Entity.  'Some of the classics  were in excellent condition.'  'She was taken home , where her condition worsened.'  'They soon reduced the Indians to a CONDITION of abject slavery .'  'They had regressed beyond any help and could never be cured of their \"bestial\" STATE of utter dependency on poor relief.'  'Evil is the outer result of a mental condition of fear, ignorance, doubt, unbelief.'   ",
    "Statement": "This frame contains verbs and nouns that communicate the act of a Speaker to address a Message to some Addressee using language. Instead of (or in addition to) a Speaker, a Medium may also be mentioned. Likewise, a Topic may be stated instead of a Message. A number of the words can be used performatively, such as declare and insist.  'I now declare you members of this Society.'   'She said that I would be late .'  'The announcement about raffle winners came across the loudspeaker.' ",
    "Stimulus_focus": "In this frame either a Stimulus brings about a particular emotion or experience in the Experiencer or  saliently fails to bring about a particular experience. Some words indicate that the Stimulus is characterized by the experience it is likely to evoke in an Experiencer and for these, the Experiencer may rarely be present. There may also be a Degree to which the Stimulus affects the Experiencer and Circumstances under which the experience occurs. There may also be a Comparison_set to which the Stimulus is compared and a Parameter that indicates the area in which the Stimulus has its effect.  ' The view is breathtaking in January. '  ' That movie was quite fascinating. '  ' That was certainly a gratifying experience.' ' The report was very alarming to me. '",
    "Stinginess": "In this frame, a Resource_controller is judged by a Judge (who is usually implicit)  according to how freely they allow the Recipient access to their Resource. The Resource_controller may exhibit this attitude with an Expressor.  'John is mean with money.' 'Sally has always been generous to her children.' ",
    "Store": "A Supply of a Resource is kept safe and available for a future Use.  The Supply may be under the control of a Possessor.  'Our supply of food is running low.'",
    "Storing": "An Agent has placed a Theme in an accessible but somewhat out of the way Location for the purposes of maintaining it free from harm and illegitimate use while it is not being used.",
    "Strictness": "These adjectives describe the degree of strictness or tolerance of an Agent, usually with regard to another person (the Controllee) and often with regard to a particular Issue.  The strictness/lenience with respect to the Issue may be manifested in (expressed by) an Agent or by some Medium (e.g., laws), or by some behavior of the Agent, i.e., the Controlling_act.  'Court says judge too lenient in rape case.INI' 'Sonny was indulgent of her admirers and allowed their attention for a time before she disappeared into the small back room.' 'Some laws are just too strict.' 'Don't be strict about cross-posting.CNI'",
    "Studying": "A Student enrolls and then remains at an Institution for the purposes of education within a Subject.  They may receive instruction from a particular Teacher at the Institution.  The Place, Time, and Duration of the study may also be specified.  'He spent ten years studying physics at the lycee before he flunked out.'    ",
    "Suasion": "A Speaker succeeds in getting an Addressee to believe or plan to execute the Content the Speaker has in mind. In most cases, the information is related to some course of action for the Addressee, and the words of this frame imply that the Addressee has formed an intention to act consistently with the Content. There is no implication that the Addressee actually acts upon the intention formed. In the case of convince and persuade, the act that the Speaker wishes the Addressee to perform can be the adoption of a belief, which may be expressed as a that-clause or as an of-PP complement.  This frame differs from Attempt_suasion in that in Suasion, the Addressee has changed their mind in accord with the Speaker's wishes, whereas in Attempt_suasion, the only implication is that the Speaker communicates with the intent of changing the mind of the Addressee.   This Frame has unique Frame-to-Frame Relations: it inherits from and uses the Eventive_cognizer_affecting frame. This is atypical of FrameNet's frame relations.  '' 'At one point, Walter tries to convince his wife that he has had a story accepted by BBC Radio.'  'They invaded the bridge, but were dissuaded from further action by the captain.'",
    "Subjective_influence": "An Agent, Situation or Entity has an influence on a Cognizer. The influence may be general; or it may be manifested in the Cognizer's engaging in an Action as a consequence of the influence; or the Cognizer may be influenced in how they carry out a Behavior that they are engaged in already. Alternatively, a Product may be specified whose production or design was influenced by the Cognizer's experience of the  Situation or Entity. ''  The  mediation of the Cognizer's psyche distinguishes this frame from the Objective_influence frame, where dependent events occur automatically given the appropriate kind of influencing force. In this frame, by contrast, a Cognizer may perceive an influence yet not respond to it in any way.  ' These works had a profound effect and influenced her in the creation of a successful series capturing this sun-drenched region.' 'I'm sure if I asked Mattel what inspired this car I would be told it's an original design, and not supposed to represent any actual car.'     ",
    "Subjective_temperature": "An Experiencer senses different degrees of warmth that may or may not be related to the ambient temperature. The level of warmth is usually compared against the Experiencer's subjective standard of comfort.  'My feet are cold.' 'The fire will keep you warm.' 'I'm too hot with this sweater on.'",
    "Submitting_documents": "A Submittor gives Documents to an Authority so that they can be processed as part of an application, evaluation or other official or bureaucratic process.   'I  was sure I had passed as soon as I handed in the test. DNI'  'She stated that she turned in the paperwork yesterday.'  'After the applicant's submission to the department, the department chairperson must evaluate.'  'I acknowledge my submission of the Material to you shall not lead to a concurrent review by any of your affiliate and subsidiary channels.'",
    "Subordinates_and_superiors": "Two individuals, the Subordinate and the Superior have a relationship such that the Subordinate generally follows orders given by the Superior and has the best interests of the Superior in mind.  'The archduke and several of his henchmen got out of the carriage, looking around nervously.'",
    "Subsisting": "An Entity survives a situation with some Support, which tends to be far below the accustomed or standard level expected. The Degree to which the Support is responsible for the Entity's survival may be mentioned, as well as the Duration for which the situation lasts.  'Harry subsisted on ramen and cheap beer through college.'",
    "Substance": "This frame concerns internally undifferentiated Substances.   'As their gut bacteria ferment cellulose , they generate methane gas , which escapes from the rear ends of the insects.'  ' The pipes are leaking noxious gas.'  'Some CH-47 \"Bombers\" were equipped to roll-out riot control gas or napalm onto Viet Cong bunker complexes from the rear cargo ramp.'",
    "Substance_by_phase": "In this frame a Patient is in a phase brought about after a change of phase.  This can be its inherent phase or indicate that it is returned to its inherent state.  'Collect up the  thawed water from the freezer section.' 'Put under the broiler until the cheese becomes melted.' 'Major companies are switching to liquefied natural gas.'",
    "Subversion": "A  Counter_actor or Cause  impedes an Agent in an Activity or impedes the unfolding or continuation of a State_of_affairs. The opposing force applies without first being noticed, often in a secret or an underhanded fashion.  'However, as this story goes on the Queen of Sodom has a brother who plans to undermine his sister and take the throne of Sodom.'  ' Diotrephes withstood John's words, and would not submit to his authority; in fact, he undermined John's authority.'  ' I don't want to get a reputation for punishing disagreement. On the other hand, he undercut me pretty badly and I can't just let it slide.'  ",
    "Success_or_failure": "An Agent has attempted to achieve a Goal, and the actual outcome of the Agent's action has been resolved, so that it either specifically matches the Agent's intent (e.g. success) or does not match it (e.g. failure).  'He pulled off his April Fool's Day prank by the barest of margins .' 'Unfortunately, we were n't successful. DNI' 'We failed miserably at getting the gay rights bill passed .'",
    "Successful_action": "The Means action by which a deprofiled agent (the Protagonist) has attempted to achieve a Goal, is finished and the actual outcome of the Means action has been resolved, so that it either specifically matches the Protagonist's intent (e.g. success) or does not match it (e.g. failure). In an alternative construal, an Instrument stands for the Means action that the deprofiled agent undertakes in order to achieve the Goal.   'Why our bid was successful. DNI' 'Your attempt to unsubscribe was unsuccessful, please try again later. DNI' ' Well I did end up replacing the old co axial cables with new monster ones and it did the trick. DNI' 'The hammer did it, not a scratch or dent in the parts as they came apart DNI.' 'What has failed in Palestine, will fail in Iraq. DNI'",
    "Successfully_communicate_message": "A Communicator speaks to an Addressee in such a way that the Addressee understands and fully appreciates the truth and/or relevance of the Message.   ' Marred by overblown writing , this first novel by Wilbur Smith 's wife effectively conveys some of South Africa 's problems .INI'  'He conveys vividly the absurdity of a situation , but he is incurious about the underlying processes which shape it. INI'  'We've got to get the message through to them before they become sexually active.'  'Have you been using PowerPoint (PPT) for years and feel you don't always get your point across to the audience?'  'It 's impossible to convey how lost I felt. CNI  INI'  'But , alas , the printed word can not adequately convey the panting , gasping misery of this particular torment. INI'",
    "Sufficiency": "An Item is located on a Scale relative to a critical value which is determined by some Enabled_situation. Generally, when the Enabled_situation is left unexpressed the Enabled_situation is interpreted to be the desirability of the Item being located within a particular range on the Scale. With many of the adjectives of this frame, the Scale is not explicitly mentioned; in such cases, the Scale is usually the quantity, incorporated in the meaning of the targets themselves, though in the case of adequacy, etc. the Scale referred to is quality.  'I probably have enough. DNI DNI'  'I was mad enough to scream.'  'I was too mad to keep myself from screaming.'  'I was way too hot. DNI'  'The particles are sufficiently small in diameter that they may be considered points.'",
    "Suicide_attack": "An Assailant attacks a Victim, intending to die in the process. In the prototypical case, the attack is designed to kill the Assailant, as when a pilot deliberately crashes a plane into the target.  'The terrorist suicide attack on U.S. troops early last week caused more damage than initially reported.'  'They kamikazed the base in the middle of the night!'",
    "Suitability": "This Frame is concerned with evaluating an Evaluee as being suitable for a Purpose or a User, presupposing some choice that is being made about which Evaluee to use for the Purpose or User.  An LU like suitable.a thus implies that, given a particular Purpose or User, the Evaluee is one which could be or ought to be chosen.  The Evaluee may be deemed suitable to a greater or lesser Degree. This frame has some similarity to the compatibility frame where two Items are evaluated with respect to their compatibility with each other against some background.  '(1) We need to build more houses suitable for local residents.' '(2) These chips are not verysuitable for parallel processing. ' '(3) We are not sure about the Cathedral's suitability for Philharmonic concerts.'",
    "Summarizing": "A Communicator processes some information (either from textual or real-world/perceptual sources) regarding a State_of_affairs into a concise form (a summary) that contains the essential content in briefer form, and communicates this summary to an Addressee, or records it in a Medium. The State_of_affairs may be represented directly (e.g., outline what happened, the situation abroad), or as a textual source (summarizing the documents), or metonymically as some focal entity (a synopsis of the candidates).  'Frank has already summarized some of the reactions on his weblog.' 'Director Van Auken gave a brief informational synopsis of each applicant. ' 'He boiled down the argument for domestic wiretapping in one plainspoken and effective, if also deceptive, line...' 'You should be able to summarize your findings to a lay audience.' 'In her materials, she also outlined the situation and major problems facing the company.'  Some LUs, such as summarize and synopsis entail a preexisting body of information that has been processed into a briefer form by the Communicator. Others, such as outline and blueprint are compatible with, but do not entail, a preexisting, fully fleshed-out concept. E.g.,  'Her book outlines a new proposal for handling grammaticalization, though she doesn't flesh it out entirely.'",
    "Supply": "A Supplier gives a Theme to a Recipient to fulfill a need or purpose (Imposed_purpose) of the Recipient.   'Habituating the ground nesting chimp groups is done by provisioning them with sugar cane. CNI INI'  'I have equipped my leech troopers with tiny subspace displacement thingummies. INI'   ' She sat down on her bed, carefully folding her clothing and packing it into the small carryall Starfleet had provided her for the journey.'",
    "Supporting": "A Supporter assists to strengthen the Supported by lending itself in material aid (or abstract assistance in the case of metaphorical uses).   'The bottom of the wall is supported by the foundation.'  'Many legislators have supported the industry in the past.'  'The revetment layers buttressed the mud-mortared cobblestone core wall.'  'Online gambling can bolster the US economy.'",
    "Surpassing": "In this frame a Profiled_item is higher that its Standard_item on a scale with respect to some Attribute. The Extent of the difference between the Standard_item and the Profiled_item may also be mentioned. Furthermore, the particular value of the standard or profiled item on a certain scale may be given by the Standard_attribute of the Profiled_attribute respectively.  ' Notices for the Shield Theater's production of Macbeth surpassed all previous reviews . '  '  Radio WKRR far surpasses all radio stations among rural radio stations  as the leading source of regional news  . '  ' We surpassed father's skills  before we were 12  . '  ' The current price surpasses the price this time last year.'",
    "Surrendering": "In this frame a Fugitive presents himself or herself to the Authorities to be subject to the criminal process. ' The bank robber surrendered to Berkeley police. ' ' Norte is expected to surrender to police tomorrow on tax fraud charges . '",
    "Surrendering_possession": "A Surrenderer is compelled to transfer a Theme to a Recipient.  'Shortly after the boy surrendered the gun, the three remaining warriors made a rush for liberty.'  'He finally surrendered the item after cops and Secret Service agents showed up at his home Saturday.'  'D?Augustino yielded the weapon to Herrick.'",
    "Surrounding": "A Figure surrounds a Ground.  The Ground location is presented as more likely to be a known location than the location of the Figure. Some lexical units entail more-or-less complete surrounding in two or three dimensions (e.g. surround.v), while others entail surrounding on only two sides (e.g. astride.prep, straddle.v).  Like other locative relations, the Figure may be any of a movable entity, an immovable entity, or an event.  'The hand around the sword-hilt was no less impressive than the sword .' 'The drug war straddles the border of the US and Mexico .'  This frame resembles the Adorning frame, in that both involve a Figure \"covering\" some Ground, but the Surrounding frame differs in that the Profiled_region is not coextensive with the Ground, as it is in the Adorning frame, and, in fact, unusually for a locative relation, the Ground entity is normally smaller than the Figure.  For this reason, the verbs of this frame are often used in the passive (restoring the normal relationship of stative subjects to oblique elements). '' In addition to several lexical units of this frame originating as metaphorical extentions of much more specific posture descriptions (straddle.v, astride.prep), this frame is itself used in a productive metaphor, involving abstract entities metaphorically \"impinging\" on other entities (in terms of derivative similarity, control, etc.), as in the following: 'that led to Dolce and Gabbana to base their autumn/winter D and G collection around her style in 2008' 'But he discovered that the literary world was a battlefield— mined with hatred, rimmed with snipers. ' 'Countless legends sprung up around the knight.'  Common abstract entities that serve as Figure include emotions ('the hopelessness surrounding them'), as well as theories, arguments, and collective philosophies ('Ageism surrounds us, but passes largely unnoticed').  This metaphor arises from the normal invited implicature of this frame that the Figure may physically impinge on the Ground, either protecting it, or limiting its motion, or even supporting it.",
    "Surviving": "A Survivor manages to avoid being negatively affected, despite encountering a Dangerous_situation. The negative effect is most often death, destruction, or a metaphorical construal of one of these.  'Wilderness Survival: Could You Survive the Wild?'  'More than 400 of the 600 residents rode out the hurricane in Gulfport's 11-story high-rise beachfront facility.'",
    "Suspicion": "A person or group, the Authority, believes that another person, the Suspect is a participant in a criminal Incident.  'The police suspect Noah Rogers of aiding the robbery last night at Shop-n-drive.'",

    "System": "A Complex with a particular Function is formed out of Component_entities. The function may be expressed by reference to a Salient_entity involved in the working of the Complex.  'The body's immune system can be mobilized against cancer. '  'The sewer system carries wastewater from homes and businesses to the Water Pollution Control Plant for treatment. '  ",
    "System_complexity": "A System is perceived as complex depending on the intricacy of the interconnectivty of its parts or components. These individual parts or components do not function as frame elements in this frame, even though they are implied by its definition. A Dimension may also be defined which situates the System within a certain domain.  '' 'San Diego freeways are a complex array of poorly maintained roads.' ' Childrens' toys are simple to assemble.' 'The hierarchy is complexin structure.' 'The newly-discovered humanoid spoke a syntactically complex language.'",
    "Take_place_of": "A New filler occupies a Role or serves a Function after the Old filler ceases to occupy the position.  In many cases, the Role or Function is implicit.   'Gas can substitute entirely for petrol.' 'Sometime in the 1880s gas replaced oil for manufacturing fuel.' 'Twelve years later, oil replaced coal as the energy of choice.' 'Honey can replace sugar in this recipe.'",
    "Taking": "An Agent removes a Theme from a Source so that the it is in the Agent's possession.  'Milton took the can of beer out of the refrigerator.'",
    "Taking_captive": "An Agent begins preventing a Captive from moving despite a tendency or desire on the part of the Captive to do so.  'Authorities recently captured several suspects who were hiding in a remote mountain area.'  'High value target has been quietly and safely secured.'",
    "Taking_sides": "A Cognizer has a relatively fixed positive or negative point of view towards an Issue.  A Side in a debate concerning an Issue or an Action of a Side may stand in for the Issue.  The Cognizer's Degree of alignment may also be specified.  'In interviews , it seems like everyone is completely against this expenditure .' ",
    "Taking_time": "An Activity takes some Time_length to complete.  If an Agent is involved they may stand in metonymically for the Activity. For some LUs (e.g., fast, speedy) the Degree to which the Activity is conceived of as taking less time than usual can be expressed.  'How long will this take?'  'The ride was speedy and often bumpy.'  'Under high-pressure situations, police officers are very fast at reacting to danger.'",
    "Talking_into": "A Speaker expresses through language his wish to get the Addressee to act.  The Addressee forms an intention to act and does so. '' 'You think I talked Peter into giving me those earrings, don't you?'  'Don't let a shop assistant talk you into buying a so-called \"orthopaedic\" bed -- there's no such thing.'",
    "Tasting": "An Agent ingests or begins to ingest a Food item that they have not had before with the intention of determining its quality on some scale. A Purpose for trying the Food may be explicitly mentioned.  'Most people will never try dog.' 'I tasted the soup to see if it had enough salt.'",
    "Team": "A Team is a group with shared goals and works toward them together in a coordinated fashion.",
    "Telling": "A Speaker addresses an Addressee with a Message, which may be indirectly referred to as a Topic. Instead of (or in addition to) a Speaker, a Medium may also be mentioned.  'I told him about the party.'",
    "Temperature": "An Entity has a Temperature characterized by the target.  The Temperature is a value of the temperature Attribute.  'The pan is already too hot to touch.'  'The walk-in was freezing, but it was better than hanging out in the kitchen.' '' Note that in this  frame, the Entity does not experience the temperature, but is merely described as being in a certain externally verifiable state.   Thus 'Open a window; I'm too hot.' is not in frame but rather in Subjective_temperature. ",
    "Temporal_collocation": "A Trajector is identified as occurring at the same time as some better-known Landmark.  We consider sequenced calendric units (e.g. Tuesday, 1987, January) as periods for the purposes of this frame.  Some lexical items allow certain types of frame elements while disallowing others (e.g. *During Tuesday...).  Several words of this frame (e.g. now.adv) have deictic incorporation of the Landmark_period.  'He tried to take care of that on his last visit .' 'I especially like brunch on Sunday.' 'Dinosaurs lived in prehistoric eras.'  'He did it then.'",
    "Temporal_pattern": "A salient Subevent has a Pattern of recurrence within a larger Process.    'Tony's fingers tapped rhythmically on the keyboard'  ",

'Jack Yan looks at how the branding profession will be affected in the early 2000s by globalization .' 'The late part of the afternoon is the worst time to get things done .' ",
    "Temporary_group": "A Temporary_group is formed from members of a Parent_organization for a particular Purpose. The Temporary_group does not exist independently within the Parent_organization. It is under the control of a Container_possessor, which also controls the Parent_organization.  'They came upon another of Whipple's scouting parties, Under Lieutenant S.M. Rains, and wiped out the entire twelve-man detachment.'  'A guard detachment from the Royal regiment was traveling with the main force to secure high-value prisoners.'",

'Breach of contract occurs where one of the parties fails to perform any one of the contract terms .' 'Breach of contract occurs where one of the parties fails to perform any one of the contract terms .'  'What are your conditions for a peaceful settlement?'  'Please read our Conditions of Sale carefully' 'Please read our Conditions of Sale carefully'  'We will verify compliance with the financial terms of the contract.'

    "Thermodynamic_phase": "This frame describes the attributes of a thermodynamic Phase of Matter.  '' 'The molten stateof the lava.'",
    "Thriving": "An Entity is in a state such that it participates in a preponderance of states and events which are desirable for it. For living entities, this may entail a proliferation of instances of the entity, or of desirable properties associated with the (single) entity. For non-living entities (economies, political locales, academic topics, etc.), this entails a proliferation of instances, or of activities that lead to instances, or any attribute that would prevent the entity from disappearing. This state is conceived of as temporary, or at least contingent on a number of changeable factors. Words expressing the opposite state, i.e., a lack of such positive activity, are also in this frame.  'In the 1920s the peach industry flourished in Upson County.'  'Construction companies thrive on public projects.'",
    "Thwarting": "In this frame a Preventing_cause interferes with the ability of a Protagonist to complete an intended Action. The Protagonist may not be mentioned in the sentence, in which case the Action is an endeavor that an individual or group of individuals hopes to accomplish.

'  ' He was foiled in his attempt to overthrow the government. '",
    "Time_period_of_action": "LUs in this frame denote a period of time in which an Enabled_action becomes possible.  The Duration of this time period can be both exact and inexact.  An Agent who performs the Enabled_action may be mentioned as well. 'Allow a three-day window for delivery.  DNI'",
    "Time_vector": "An Event is identified as occurring at a particular Distance and in a particular Direction from a Landmark_event.   The lexical units incorporate the Direction and, in some cases, the Landmark_event.   This frame builds on the Direction frame, further specifying the Domain as Time.  This frame will receive some of the lexical units currently found in Relative_time.  ' Tell me that a week from now. ' ' Some twelve months after I had graduated, I had my first job interview'",
    "Timespan": "The words in this frame describe a period of time, as opposed to a point in time.  'The best time of year for planting tends to be fairly regular.' ",
    "Timetable": "A Timetable of Events is a mental object deliberately created, modified or kept by a Cognizer. The Timetable is often modified by an adjective depicting a Period_of_iterations or a dependent noun expressing the Events of the Timetable.  Note that this frame does not include the physical representation of a timetable.  '' As of now this frame does not have an inheritance relationship, but in the future a *Mental_object frame will be developed from which Timetable will inherit. ''  'Changes to an employee's work schedule should generally be approved prior to the change actually occuring.'  'The science students had very full timetables; these consisted mainly of lectures, with some lab sessions and problem classes or tutorials.'",
    "Tolerating": "The words in this frame describe an Experiencer's feelings of tolerating with respect to some Content. A Reason for the toleration may also be expressed.  Although the Content may refer to an actual, current state of affairs, quite often it refers to a general situation which causes the emotion.    ' He could not tolerate the smell of coconut . '",
    "Tool_purpose": "A living entity intends a Tool to be able to fulfill a generic Purpose.  The material from which the tool is created can be something natural or something manmade, including another tool.  'The use of a saw is to cut down trees.'",
    "Topic": "A stretch of linguistic discourse or a Text that a Communicator produces has a Topic that it is about.  'Chapter 5 discusses the issue of transubstantiation.' 'Smither's essay is about plane spotting.' ' Ostrovsky addresses monetary policy in Chapter 5.' 'This book is mostly about particle physics.'",
    "Touring": "A Tourist experiences an Attraction, a location with a unique history or other societally recognized individual character, with the goal of seeing and learning about it. Typically, the Attraction has a source of information about the Attraction--a guide, pamphlets, or displays.  'We toured the Grand Canyon.' ",
    "Toxic_substance": "A Toxic_substance causes death or harm when introduced into or absorbed by a living organism, the Victim. The Toxic_substance may be specified to be produced by or contained in a Toxin_source. The Toxic_substance may affect the Victim as a whole or a particular Body_part (understood here to include organs and other sub-systems). A Degree of harmfulness  can be specified  and the Toxic_substance  may develop  its effect only under particular Circumstances.  'The  main product , sulphide , is toxic to cells '  'They are better tolerated and  are less toxic in overdose'  'The reason he was close to danger was because an extremely poisonous beetle was crawling down his shoulder.'  'Ingested gliadin and PT-gliadin are toxic to coeliac patients.'",
    "Transfer": "This frame involves a Donor transferring a Theme to a Recipient.  'I transferred $20 to his account.' ",
    "Transfer_scenario": "In this scenario, the Theme begins in the possession of the Donor and ends up in the possession of the Recipient.  Alternatively, these two participants may be jointly construed as Transferors.  ",
    "Transition_to_a_quality": "An Entity ends up with a particular new Final_quality.    'The milk has gone sour already .'  There is only one lexical unit, go.v, that evokes this frame directly in English, and it combines only with a limited set of Final_quality types, such as undesirability (bad, sour), insanity (crazy), inability (limp), or posture (prone).  However, the frame itself is intended to cover situations with arbitrary Final_quality types.  As such, frames describing simple state change should inherit from this frame, incorporating the Final_quality FE as part of the background meaning of the frame.",
    "Transition_to_a_situation": "An Entity ends up in a Final_situation.   'I have come to appreciate good coffee .' 'We have come to expect three meals a day .' 'When the history of our times comes to be written , They Organized Themselves to Death will be the only possible epitaph . ' '' This frame should be compared to the more general Transition_to_a_state, which also includes changes to a Final_category and a Final_quality. '' This frame should be compared to Process_start and Activity_start.  Unlike Process_start's Process FE and Activity_start's Activity FE, the Final_situation need not be conceived of as an ongoing event.  Also, there is no emphasis on the temporal profiling in Transition_to_a_situation other than the before (where the Final_situation is not true) to the after (where the Final_situation is true).",
    "Transition_to_state": "An Entity ends up in a Final_category, Final_situation, or Final_quality which it was not in before.  Some members of the frame (e.g. grow.v) tend to emphasize a gradual change, while most members of the frame do not indicate whether a change is gradual or not.    'Why I became an Emacs user'  'I left the ministry and became an atheist.'  'Surprisingly, various veteran organizations also turned vehemently antiwar.'  ' Over the years she grew to hate him.'  This frame should be compared to Undergoing_change.  Undergoing_change is different in that it much more emphasizes the difference between the pre- and post-states of the Entity.  This shows up both in Undergoing_change's increased occurrence with Initial_category and Initial_state (change from red to blue) and in its increased occurrence with Final_category (changed into a toad) rather than Final_situation or Final_quality (?changed to red vs. became/turned red).  In addition, when Undergoing_change occurs with the Final_category frame element, it presents a deep difference between the Initial_category and the Final_category, so that it is humorous to say 'she turned into a Republican', because it presents this as a fundamental change of identity; compare to 'she became a Republican', which is quite normal.  In a less humorous example, someone can 'turn into a Mac user', strongly implying that they no longer use their former operating system, while if they 'become a Mac user', this is either as a replacement of other OS's or potentially as an addition to the use of other OS's.",
    "Transitive_action": "This frame characterizes, at a very abstract level, an Agent or Cause affecting a Patient. This frame is inherited by many lower-level frames. ",
    "Translating": "A Cognizer produces a Target_symbol which represents, in the Target_representation format, a Content that pre-exists in the form of a Source_symbol in a Source_representation format. ''  'This word is sometimes  translated as ` girl '. CNI'  'They all wore symbolic black clothes over bright yellow T-shirts and all spoke in Welsh, their statements being translated into English afterwards. CNI'  'His texts were translated from French into Scots by Carl Gronau.'  'Perhaps when Irish monks spoke in Latin about lionn, meaning ale, they translated the word literally from Irish into Latin as biber, 'drink'.'  'Each of the ten Greek nouns below can be accurately translated by using just one English word. CNI.'",
    "Transportation_status": "A Rider is being transported in a Vehicle, or is moving on foot.  'Mounted police officers are a common sight in this village.'  'You mean to say they are on foot?'",
    "Trap": "A Deceiver sets up a Trap in order to cause a Victim to have an incorrect understanding about a situation. The Deceiver anticipates that this will lead the Victim to take a course of action (including doing nothing) which causes the Victim harm.  'Setting a trap for your opponents is usually a good strategy.'  'It's a trap!'",
    "Travel": "In this frame a Traveler goes on a journey, an activity, generally planned in advance, in which the Traveler moves from a Source location to a Goal along a Path or within an Area.  The journey can be accompanied by Co-participants and Baggage.  The Duration or Distance of the journey, both generally long, may also be described as may be the Mode_of_transportation.  Words in this frame emphasize the whole process of getting from one place to another, rather than profiling merely the beginning or the end of the journey. 'Ellen journeyed to Europe with five suitcases.' 'Samantha journeyed 2500 miles with her family by sea to China.''The Osbournes took a trip from Beverly Hills to London on the Concorde.'",
    "Traversing": "A Theme changes location with respect to a salient location, which can be expressed by a Source, Path, Goal, Area, Direction, Path_shape, or Distance, as shown in the examples below: ''  'Start your ascent from Achintree Farm in Glen Nevis.'  'We crossed the desert.'  'She jumped across the ditch that marked the entrance to the woods.'  'The children hopped into the neighbor's yard.'  'I leaped twenty feet before slipping and falling.'  'As they did so, the plane circled lower.'  'Boyner has been crisscrossing the country since May.'",
    "Treating_and_mistreating": "In this frame an Agent is evaluated as behaving toward an Affected_Party in some Manner, which may or may not be incorporated into the target LU.  'Douglas always treated Mary well.'",
    "Trendiness": "A Behavior, attributed to an Evaluee, conforms with or is heavily influenced by a popular trend or practice, often in the realm of fashion, design, though extending social and interactional behavior in general. Trendiness differs from Popularity in adding a factor of aesthetic or other judgment to behaviors and individuals, and judging these with respect to social behavior; Popularity is about amount of acceptability or utilization based on general (often non-aesthetic) desirability.  'Wearing flowered brocaded silks was fashionable in the first few years of the decade.'",
    "Trial": "A trial is a process conducted in a Court before a Judge and (usually) a Jury in which the participants meet in order to decide a Case.  The Prosecution attempts to prove that the Defendant is guilty of the Charges and the Defense tries to prove that the Defendant is innocent.  Trials have a rich schematic structure which is only partially represented here.  The Trial frame is the part of the Criminal Process frame that occurs after a crime, Arrest of a suspect, Arraignment, jury selection, etc. and before Sentencing and punishment or release.  The Trial is made up of court appearances.  The beginning of the Trial generally involves opening arguments, in which the Prosecution and the Defense present their respective points of view.  Then during the course of the Trial, both sides present evidence, some of which is provided by witnesses with testimony, and this is then drawn upon as support for their arguments.  Following the presentation of evidence, testimony, and arguments, generally culminating in closing arguments for each side, the Jury (if present) deliberates and either comes to no sufficient consensus or produces a Verdict.",
    "Triggering": "A Cause triggers a System to operate in accordance with its intended purpose. Alternatively, an Actor (acting volitionally or not) which participates in the Cause, stands in for the Cause. The System often has the capability to detect and signal the presence of an object or the occurence of an event (metal, an earthquake). It may also be or contain an explosive device. The Means by which the Cause activates the System may also be specified.  'Smoking a cigarette will normally not set off a smoke alarm.'  'Suspected drug traffickers set off 12 bombs, injuring 35 people.'  'Joseph wriggled out of the ropes and inadvertantly triggered the burglar alarm.'",
    "Trust": "A Cognizer thinks that the Information given by a particular Source is correct.  The specific Content or Topic of the Information may also be described. '' 'I don't trust this information.'  'Nobody will believe you, and people will think you're scum.'",
    "Try_defendant": "A Defendant is tried by a Jury or Judge in a Court for Charges.  This frame perspectivalizes the general Trial frame.  'The state will try him for fraud.'",
    "Trying_out": "An Evaluator participates in an Experience (or metonymically, a salient Entity of the Experience), often for the first time, in order to form an opinion about its quality. The aspect of quality that is being judged is often implicit but may be expressed as the Purpose of the Evaluator's participation.   'Have you tried my latest get-rich-quick scheme? INI' 'Don tried out the bike to see if it was the right size.'",
    "Turning_out": "A State_of_affairs turns out to be true in someone's knowledge of the world. This may be recognized with evidence or in certain circumstances. The cognizer whose beliefs are affected is not expressed.  'Hybrid grass may prove to be a valuable fuel source.'",
    "Type": "This frame has to do with nouns denoting types of entities. The Subtype refers to a collection of members of a more general Category which have certain defining characteristics; alternatively, the Subtype refers only to the type itself, i.e. a more restrictive set of characteristics than those of the more general Category.  The properties of the items that are included in the collection may be specified by the Item_Property.  Sometimes the Subtypes themselves are described by some Type_Property.  'I don't like this newfangled kind of  fish.' 'Kleo isn't our sort of people.' 'He argued against the formalist type of analysis of art.' 'I think that she was referring to the other type. DNI'",
    "Typicality": "A State_of_affairs is generally, or with regard to a particular Feature, representative of its class, which may be narrowed to a specific Comparison_set.  'The Elan truly is an unusual car; the first and only Lotus with a front engined/front wheel drive layout, and the first new Lotus to be introduced since 1975.'  ' I need a plain, vanilla example that doesn't use PRINT! '  'How smart is the average drug user/experimenter? '  'It's not unusual to be loved by anyone, It's not unusual to have fun with anyone,'  'Is lying normal for a child this age, and how can I best handle this situation?'",
    "Unattributed_information": "A Reported_fact is presented by the speaker as deriving from statements (made directly to them or to others) of third parties.  'Four purported gang members could face death penalty in Virginia slaying of federal informant.'",
    "Undergo_change": "An Entity changes, either in its category membership, its situation, or in terms of the quality of an Attribute. In the first case, where category membership is changing, an Initial_category and a  Final_category may be expressed. In the second case, where a situation as a whole is changing, an Initial_situation and a Final_situation can be present. And in the last case, where some characterization of the Entity is changing, an Initial_quality and a Final_quality can be specified.    'As soon as Tiffany kissed the frog, Tiffany turned into a frog. '  'He chanted and the rock changed shape, becoming a great double bitted axe.'  'The College has changed markedly over the century since it first opened its doors.'  'If I'm understanding you correctly, you want the switchbar color to change whenever the bot says something?'  'My life instantly changed from an empty life, to a life full of joy and purpose.'  'As you can see, the word WALK changed from red to green rather than have a separate lens for each colour.'  'My feet turned to stone.'  'The promise will turn to ashes if progress is not made.'  'The price  changed from $1.26 to $1.27 per pint. DNI'  'At least one relative instruction has changed in size from short to long.'  In some cases, the types of perspective are mixed, so that, e.g., an Initial_quality is mixed with a Final_situation; this is usually considered poor style.  'She went from confused to acting completely confident .'  This frame is often the target domain of motion metaphors, in which the moving Theme corresponds to the  changing Entity, the Source of motion corresponds to the Initial_category, Initial_quality, or Initial_situation and the Goal of motion corresponds to the Final_category, Final_quality, or Final_situation of the Entity.  By correspondence with the complex domain of motion, this metaphor introduces several FEs to the target domain of change, such as an Intermediate_state (etc.) from Path, and Tendency_of_change from Direction.  'The nation was crawling towards oblivion.' 'We were walking past almost reasonable and heading right for what-the-bleep.' ",
    "Undergo_transformation": "An Entity changes from one kind of thing (Initial_category) to another kind of thing (Final_category).  Whether the Initial_category is mentioned or not, the change is viewed as negating some Initial_category, and not simply adding an additional Final_category to the Entity.  'She metamorphosed from a mere coworker into a friend .' 'His mother had transformed into a rock star . INI ' 'The metamorphosis of his attitude from benign neglect to active hatred was so slow he never noticed .' 'The transformation from Ms. Nobody had taken her years . DNI INI ' ",
    "Undergoing": "An Entity is affected by an Event.  'The hotel is undergoing renovations at this time.'",
    "Undergoing_scenario": "In this scene, an Event occurs, and an Entity is affected by it.",
    "Undressing": "A Wearer removes an item of Clothing from a Body_location (the part of the body that the Clothing is prototypically worn on.)  'Walking on sand is better if you take off your shoes. INI'",
    "Unemployment_rate": "Based on how many Individuals are employed, the Individuals as a whole are described with a Value (either a percentage or absolute number) representing the Employment of the Individuals.  'Unemployment is down, salaries are up for US chemists.'  'As a result, the unemployment of Roma is very high.'  'Today's report finds that unemployment among single mothers rose for the first time in six years in 2002. DNI'  'In the 1950s and '60s, joblessness of 6 to 7 percent was intense, but now an unemployment rate of below 6 percent could be inflationary. DNI. '  'The economy was operating at full capacity, traditionally defined as employment of 96 percent of the civilian labor force. DNI'  ",
    "Use_firearm": "An Agent causes a Firearm to discharge, usually directing the projectile from the barrel of the Firearm (the Source), along a Path, and to a Goal. 'The Germans wouldn't stop shooting cannons at them.' 'Oswald fired twice through the window.'",
    "Use_vehicle": "A Driver transports themselves and possibly other passengers (the Theme) to another location.",
    "Used_up": "Through use, a Resource is diminished in quality or quantity (up to complete attrition) such that it becomes less capable of sustaining future use.   'My entire life savings is depleted due to university and medical bills.'  'All significant oil and gas reserves are exhausted or have dwindled to an uneconomical level except for those of the Middle East.'  'Use shampoo and conditioner every day until the shampoo and conditioner are completely used up.'",
    "Usefulness": "An Entity aids in the successful completion of a Purpose.  Its Degree of utility may also be expressed. Some of the lexical units  in this frame (e.g. great, good) can only express permanent, generic states of the Entity.  'A box is an ideal storage device.'",
    "Using": "An Agent manipulates an Instrument in order to achieve a Purpose.  'For cold conditions, we recommend that you use a heat gun or a hair dryer to make the adhesive work better. '",
    "Using_resource": "An Agent has access to a finite amount of some Resource and uses it in some way to complete a Purpose. The specific Portion of the Resource may be stated, and after the Resource is spent, it is no longer available to the Agent. The Means by which the Resource is used may be mentioned, but it is often implied by the stated Purpose or understood based on what the Resource is.  'I used half of the bag of dirt to plant the roses.' 'She just spends all her time sitting in front of the television.'",
    "Vehicle": "The frame concerns the vehicles that human beings use for the purpose of transportation.  'I drove a limo to the school dance.'",
    "Vehicle_departure_initial_stage": "A Vehicle moves into position or otherwise changes configuration or state as preparation for normal operation. The focus of the event is on the state of the Vehicle rather than any agent which is manipulating the Vehicle.  'The flight for New York finally lifted off from Oakland International with one hundred passengers aboard.'",
    "Vehicle_landing": "A flying Vehicle comes to the ground at a Goal in a controlled fashion, typically (but not necessarily) operated by an operator.  'A police helicopter landed just outside my neighborhood at around midnight last night.'  'The UFO touched down here, you say?'",
    "Vehicle_subpart": "An entity is integrated into a vehicle as a Part of a (possibly unexpressed) Whole which may refer to the whole vehicle or merely to a sub-part of the vehicle.  '' 'The car's engine started smoking so we pulled over.' 'Put the bags in the trunk.' 'One should always wear a seatbelt while driving.' ",
    "Verdict": "In this frame, which is a  part of the Trial sequence, a Judge gives a Finding with respect to the Charges against the Defendant in a particular Case.  'He was convicted of fraud by Judge Judy.'",
    "Verification": "An Inspector attains a degree of certainty in the Unconfirmed_content, generally by inspecting some evidence.  'This note confirms my suspicions.'",
    "Version_sequence": "An entity goes through several versions, from initial to final.  'This is my first draft.'",
    "Victim_operated_IED": "An improvised explosive device, the Bomb, is placed so as to be hidden from view or disguised as something not harmful. It is rigged to detonate when triggered by actions of an intended Victim. Possible triggering actions include stepping on a pressure-sensitive plate, activating a trip-wire, or moving an object which activates a spring-loaded device.  'We hit a VOIED and the lead truck was destroyed.'",
    "Violence": "The words in this frame describe acts (or situations characterized by acts) that cause injury or harm. The acts may involve an Aggressor or Cause injuring a Victim, or Aggressors causing each other harm.  'Research on whether concealed carry laws increase gun violence among gang members has been inconclusive.'  'They committed brutality against innocent civilians.'  'The storm's violence last week came without warning and caused unprecedented damage to costal regions.'",
    "Visit_host": "A Visitor matches location with a Host by going to a place strongly associated with a Host, the Host_location (often a place of residence, employment, or government), in order to achieve a Purpose. The Host allows the use of his/her resources. The visit is often social in nature.",
    "Visit_host_arrival": "The Visitor arrives at the Host_location to visit the Host.",
    "Visit_host_departure": "A Visitor departs from a Host_location after having visited a Host.",
    "Visit_host_stay": "A Visitor is located with a Host for a visit.",
    "Visiting": "An Agent matches location with an Entity in order to fulfill some  Purpose.  Quite often, the Purpose is social- or entertainment-oriented.  'I ca n't remember how many times he visited ! DNI' 'Now she was on an inspection visit .' 'You have to visit your parents every once in a while .'",
    "Visiting_scenario": "An Agent and an Entity become co-located. The Agent in pursuit of a Purpose, and temporarily remains with the Entity to fulfill this Purpose and then departs again, usually back to their Normal_location.",
    "Visiting_scenario_arrival": "An Agent arrives at a location that should help them achieve their Purpose. This situation is point-of-view-neutral.",
    "Visiting_scenario_departing": "An Agent departs from the Source, normally bound for their normal location. This is a point-of-view-neutral conception of the departure.",
    "Visiting_scenario_stay": "An Agent matches location with an Entity in order to fulfill some  Purpose. Quite often, the Purpose is social- or entertainment-oriented. This scene is point-of-view-neutral.",
    "Visitor_and_host": "A Visitor and a Host become co-located at a location strongly associated with the Host. The Visitor is allowed by the Host to use the Host's location and/or resources for the achievement of a Purpose. The visit is often social in nature.",
    "Visitor_arrival": "An Agent arrives at a Goal that should enable their Purpose.",
    "Visitor_departure": "After a visit is complete, the Agent departs the Source, normally bound for their normal haunts.",
    "Visitor_scenario": "An Agent leaves their Normal_location and matches location with an Entity in pursuit of a Purpose.  The Agent temporarily remains with the Entity to fulfil this Purpose and then departs again, usually back to the Normal_location.",
    "Vocalizations": "This frame is concerned with the sounds produced by animate entities by means of their vocal tracts. Descriptions of sounds from artifacts meant to emulate such sounds, or to act as vocalizing animals or people, are also treated here as figurative language.  'He woke up because of the cries of the crows outside.'",
    "Volubility": "These words describe the size of message that a Speaker is judged by a (usually unexpressed) Judge to give, either in a specific occasion or Topic or in general. As in other communication frames, Medium may also be expressed. '' 'Graham is very shy with most people, but he gets very chatty with Mr. Roberts.'  'Evelyn was very voluble on the rights of women.'",
    "Wagering": "A Gambler commits an Asset to a prediction that an Uncertain_situation will have a particular Outcome (or class of outcomes). He or she loses the Asset if the prediction ends up being incorrect, and gains it back plus additional winnings if the prediction ends up correct.  'He bet $30 on the horse race.'",
    "Waiting": "A Protagonist delays a planned action because they cannot or do not want to proceed until an Expected_event occurs. The Expected_event may be evoked by reference to a Salient_entity that participates in it.  If a Salient_entity is expressed, the Expected_event is typically the arrival of the Salient_entity at the Place where the Protagonist is located.   'The cat waited on top of the washer as Elmer popped the lid off the can of cat food and then pounded the can's contents onto the plate'  'The family was furious that their 84-year-old dad had to wait 52 hours in the emergency room.'  Although in both frames a Protagonist/Agent is not performing some desired action for some period of time, the use of wait.v in this frame is different from that in Holding_off_on in that Waiting prominently portrays a future event that will allow the Protagonist to proceed (with doing something), whereas Holding_off_on does not necessarily imply that there is some event or state-of-affairs that will allow the Agent to proceed, rather focussing on the action that the Agent is not yet taking.  ",
    "Waking_up": "A Sleeper transitions from a state of consciousness where they are largely unaware of their environment to a wakeful state.  'William awoke from a dream.'",
    "Want_suspect": "A Suspect has been investigated and has a warrant issued for his or her arrest on certain Charges. ' Bill is wanted on murder charges. '",
    "Warning": "A Speaker warns an Addressee by giving a Message that describes an undesirable situation that may affect the Addressee. The warning may alternatively be described as about Topic pertaining to the undesirable situation, or issued via a specific Medium.  'Jackson warned me that the weather could change quickly, but I guess I didn't really believe him.'  'We alerted officials about the possibility of containment failure as soon as we realized it could happen.'  'They issued the warning to only those with the highest security clearence. DNI'",
    "Waver_between_options": "A Cognizer faces a choice on some Issue. They have several Options  available but keep changing their mind between Option_1 and Option_2. The Cognizer may in fact act on their choice at some point but they need not; the Options can simply be considered for some time with one being favored for a while and then the other.  'Dave Hayes wavered about moving to California because so many of his friends are in Baltimore.'  'He had wavered between half a dozen places; it was pure chance that he had chosen Marvis Bay.'  'In any event, I still go back and forth on what I want to do. '  'He was firm in his beliefs, never waffled from one platform to another and was always harshly clear in his stance.'  'Upper management waffled whether Fletcher fit their salary structure.'",
    "Wealthiness": "A Person or Institution is being described in terms of their wealthiness, in other words the amount of money in their possession. 'Jess is very rich.' 'The university is wealthy.' ",
    "Weapon": "A Weapon is an artifact created specifically to cause harm or damage.  In some cases, a Use, Material of construction, Part or Type may be more narrowly specified.  'Did you, or did you not, fire this gun with intent to harm my client?'  'Cyra tried to swing her sword to parry, but it was to heavy.'  'I investigated a specialist precious metal firearms manufacturer.'  'My neighbor, a member of the NRA since birth, has got an AK-47 fully automatic assault rifle.'  'Let 's just say that he 's the kind of guy who likes guns with hair triggers.' ",
    "Wearing": "The words in this frame refer to what Clothing the Wearer (or a specific Body_part of the Wearer) has on.  'I had on the most ridiculous monkey-suit you could imagine.' 'These two losers were wearing bras on their heads!'  Many targets incorporate the Clothing item, and some targets describe the state of not wearing something (when it might be expected).  'Do you think anyone would notice if I went topless?'    NB: There is a very common metonymy in which characteristics of the clothing stand for the clothing itself, such as   'the man clad in leather.' 'She was dressed all in red.'  Such sentences should be tagged METAPHOR on the sentence level.",
    "Weather": "Ambient conditions of temperature, precipitation, windiness, and sunniness pertain at a certain Place and Time.  Further Specification of the conditions that pertain may also be indicated. 'A blustery storm blew in.' 'There was a thick blizzard last night.' 'An armada of hailstorms swept through the region.'",
    "Wholes_and_parts": "A Whole is made up of multiple Parts, which themselves may not be independent of each other or of the Whole. Wholes_and_parts is contrasted with Set_relation, where the Whole is simply a set of a number of (usually independent) parts.",
    "Willingness": "A Cognizer would engage in an Activity if asked or otherwise prompted to do so.  'The court is willing to depart from the usual range of sentencing .'  'The Nicaraguan National Assembly has been reluctant to destroy the remaining stockpile. '  'The Turks are in grudging acceptance of terms set by EU.'  'Would you be preparedto give up some of your privacy to industry to help improve customer service?'",
    "Win_prize": "A Competitor claims a Prize as a result of the outcome of their participation in a Competition.  Competition is meant to be construed broadly to include cases where there is no skill involved as well as cases where there is no ranking of participants, and indeed does not require that there be multiple pariticipants or a definable end of game, as in the case of winning prizes at a carnival game. All that is required to be this kind of Competition is that there is some way of determining whether a Competitor will receive the Prize.  'We won a car in the raffle.'  ''  The use of win.v in this frame is similar to the Finish_competition frame, but there are a number of differences. Firstly, Win_prize focuses on what the Competitor receives as a result of their participation in a process. Unlike Finish_competition, Win_prize does not necessarily give any information about how a Competitor ranked relative to other competitors, or even if there is any system of ranking of competitors, or any end of the process that is defined as winning or losing. Win_prize only requires a system for determining which Prize or prizes go to a Competitor, if any. That is why the opposite of \"I won (something)\" in Win_prize is not \"I lost\", but rather \"I didn't win anything\".",

    "Word_relations": "One linguistic unit, Sign_1, has a relation to another linguistic unit, Sign_2. This relation may be semantic, phonological, orthographic, or distributional in nature. The parameter along which the two signs are set in relation to each other is incorporated in the meaning of the target words in this frame. When the relation is symmetrical, the two linguistic units can be expressed jointly, Signs. Otherwise they have to be expressed disjointly. Ordinarily it is assumed that one linguistic unit has exactly one meaning but in cases where this is not so, a set of Circumstances may be specified that helps pick out the relevant sense.  ' Happy and sad are antonyms.' 'In one sense, dog is a hyponym of itself.' ",

'Volunteers were staffing the telephones.'  'Man your stations! CNI'"
